I have the sense of humor of an idiot stoner and I constantly have the Bad Movie Opinions I loved XMen Apocalypse bc it felt just like the original 80s Apocalypse comics so corny and cheesy and dorky but still way too dramatic I basically really enjoyed this movie for the same reasons It was dorky and stupid and fun just like the XForce comics I grew up on It was super fun for me as a dumb mutant geek
