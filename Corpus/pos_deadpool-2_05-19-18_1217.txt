A lot of sequels are basically just the first film but bigger yet rarely ever better DEADPOOL 2 might be the rare exception There are certain jokes set pieces and plot beats that reminded me of the original without ever being a specific callback And in almost every instance these parallels were improvements So if you liked the first film you will like this one If you didnt like the first film you might like this one
