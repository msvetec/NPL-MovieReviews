Funnier than the first one Longer than the first one Lots of references A little flabby in places as it attempts to squeeze the very last comic value from its self aware fruits Reynolds timing is as punchy as ever and Brolin plays a rather solid straight man Surprisingly enjoyable to be honest not perfect but a comfortable entertaining and funny time at the cinema
