When the jokes land they land pretty well Unfortunately only like 10 percent or less of the jokes landed for me This is just because I have an interesting sense of humor that makes it very hard for movies to make me laugh Overall most of that type of humor is just not for me And since these movies are pretty much rooted in their comedy at this point I cant say that I have loved either one of them
