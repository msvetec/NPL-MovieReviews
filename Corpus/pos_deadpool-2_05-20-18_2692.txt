The script offers a more sincere take in an attempt in growing the Deadpool character from a jester to a real hero If you come for the fourth wall breaks it may seem that the film is lacking in that department in favor of more situational comedic moments or fan service but overall its a film that works The supporting players seem more onboard with the zany aspects of the movie and having them be apart of the fun was fun
