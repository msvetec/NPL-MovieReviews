Oh man Deadpool 2 was such a disappointment to me especially because I was such a huge fan of the first one Let me preface this by saying that this has my favorite postfilm scene of all time It is absolutely fantastic and was definitely the funniest part of the entire film I will always acknowledge that Deadpool is still as perfect as always and his comedy will never be subpar in my opinionÂ
