Well I gave the first movie 55 and this one was at least as good as that one hilarious love the comedy in my superhero movies was almost crying laughing twice   Zazie Beetz crushes it as Domino love her in Atlanta as well and Josh Brolin was a great Cable   cant wait to see it again they throw so much quick wit at you I feel like I missed some of it
