I was recently on a road trip and saw a restaurant that I thought had an amusing name I mentioned to the person I was driving with I wanted a shirt from there since the name was so funny We looked online and suddenly realized that yes not only did the restaurant have an amusing name but they were hyperaware of the fact All of their shirts took that one entertaining aspect and twisted it in a thousand different ways
