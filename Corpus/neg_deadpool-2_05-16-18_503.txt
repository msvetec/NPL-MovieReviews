Deadpool 2 doubles down on everything that was good about the first one especially the meta humor Almost every other joke is a reference to something and after a while it became a little monotonous Now had it all made me laugh it wouldve been fine but it was pretty hit and miss for me The film isnt without its laughs and great lines just nothing gutbusting for me personally Its still entertaining when it comes to the action scenes and the characters but it was a step down from the first one for me unfortunately But the midcredits scene is quite funny
