Sequels mostly the second parts end up being overdone But quite surprisingly Deadpool just got a lot better on the contrary While Deadpool 2016 meandered on borderline average Deadpool 2 2018 is solid entertainment with more sidesplitting comic homages and amusing action setpieces Ryan Reynolds shows much more conviction in the followup act The unwearying wit of the material rather helps Also much credits to the supporting cast of characters Josh Brolin as Cable Domino Firefist Colossus and the XMen team Dopinder The XForce Deadpool 2 is so much fun
