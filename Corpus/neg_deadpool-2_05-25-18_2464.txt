Kudos to Film Twitter for spending so much time dunking on this franchise that my expectations were low enough to actually enjoy it Its stupid and corny at the very best but the vitriol is a little absurd Its like those kids in school that would spend so much energy criticizing Family Guy Why are you operating in a cultural sphere that even puts you in a room with Family Guy or Deadpool to start If you bought a ticket to whatever this is or is trying to be you cant really try and get on a pedestal over it You should just stop watching
