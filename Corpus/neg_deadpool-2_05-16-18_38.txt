The first Deadpool was surprisingly good It was funny and small enough to stand out from the influx of stupidly largescale superhero dominating the current blockbuster landscape It even held up on a rewatch Unfortunately Deadpool 2 is a cumbersome and messy movie that doesnt seem to hold up even on first watch
