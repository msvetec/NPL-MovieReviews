for a movie with that many jokes i sure expected to laugh more its fine while this one has a grander scale than the first its tired metaschtick is just more of the same first half was pretty boring but after he assembles the team it starts to pick up and gets noticeably funnier i laughed a handful of times but that basic instinct reference fuckin got meÂ if you liked the first a lot i bet youll like this one
