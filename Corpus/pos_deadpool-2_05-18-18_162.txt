I am a massive Deadpool fanboy he is my favorite comic book character of all time so it may be best to preface this by advising to take my opinion with a heavy grain of salt Ill start off with this if you didnt like the first Deadpool then the sequel certainly isnt going to be any better to you Its rife with the same selfreferential humor and consistent fourth wallbreaking that made the first film so endearing to me
