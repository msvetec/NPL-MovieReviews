Well much the same as the first one which I guess is what you want Some funny stuff some more violent action and another pretty standard story Its a bit much to ask your audience to emotionally invest in the main character when half the film is spent selfreferentially making fun of him Im picky with my time travel so the character of Cable is hugely problematic for me but the xmen timeline is so screwed beyond any coherent recognition by this stage that I guess everybody stopped caring Its a fun diversion
