Deadpool 2 is a fun ride once it gets going about halfway into the film Its cool to hear references to other movies and universes but they relied to heavily on those punchlines and most didnt work for me and the pacing of the film makes it feel longer than what it is I had fun with the third act of the film but overall its pretty mediocre at best
