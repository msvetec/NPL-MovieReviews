Doesnt quite capture the whipsmart irreverence of the first but theres a lot to love here and ultimately I had a blast The narrative is a little messy at times theres a particularly annoying storytelling decision ie clich√© very early on but Reynolds brings his Agame to the role he was born to play Brolin makes a great Cable and Zazie Beetz as Domino proves to be the films secret weapon Laughs action and surprising and fun cameos abound  bring on XForce
