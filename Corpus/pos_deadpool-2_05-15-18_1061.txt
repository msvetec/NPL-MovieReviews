This was FUN Lots of action knows how to make fun of itself somehow manages to squeeze in a few serious moments without making it look ridiculous Delightful after credits scenes Ryan Reynolds proves himself as Deadpool once again Cable is pretty badass All in all it is entertaining action packed and funny If you liked the first part go see it you wont be disappointed
