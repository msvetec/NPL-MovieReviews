Fucking Hell just wrote a longass review and then lost internet connection right before submitting and lost the whole thing Basically I didnt think it was as funny as the first though it had better characters and didnt fall apart as badly in the final act as the previous one did The XForce scenes were funny but overall I didnt find myself laughing much especially during the first hour I wish the jokes had been more clever or at least
