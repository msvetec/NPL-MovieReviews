I just wanted to sit this movie down and tell it that it is ok to be itself It doesnt need to throw us around and be a serious emotional film only to then suck us back out and laugh at how serious it was It doesnt need to metacompete with every other film in existance by consistently mentioning so many other movies that it slowly fails to become engaging on its own termsÂ
