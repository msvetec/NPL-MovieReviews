Its rare for a sequel but I would definitely say that for the reasons I liked deadpool 1 I liked Deadpool 2 even more The action was more intense the comedy was more fourth wall breaking and the characters were perfect The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is that the plot seemed a little scattered but overall it was still great Mr Pool embodies what an R rated superhero comedy should be and I wish there were more films and characters like him
