Dont think deadpool would be my favorite superhero ever Not because I dont get the jokes but simply because nothing super here not enough plot story Fun movie Yes But not really an impressive one Ryan Reynolds deadpool can be replaced by anyone else compared to Hugh Js Logan which is so much more charismatic rude yet charming at the same time and cannot be replaced or hard to find the new one
