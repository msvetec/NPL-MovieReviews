Ultra violent Loved this flick but a little overtly wink wink every lines a gag And the whole were in a movie gets a little old Thought the first installment had just the right mix of comedy and action this one is so over the top it doesnt let u settle in and enjoy a lot of the killer fx fight scenes ect I loved the musical tie ins Take on me mirroring the mtv video Gabriels In your eyes All out of love just awesome Juggernaut lots of fun Brad Pitt cameo amusing Laugh out loud funny in places
