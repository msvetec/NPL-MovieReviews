First time a movie that I saw in theaters actually ended up better the original The director was right when he said were getting more action and dramatic scenes Admittedly Josh Brolin as Cable is better than him being Thanos His motive is just so tragic And yes the movie is still funny even when Wade calls Cable Thanos I have to say its the best superhero film of 2018 so far
