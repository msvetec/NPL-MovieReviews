I was never very fan of Deadpool but I was surprised with the 2 when the movie ended I said I want to watch again the writers were very creative to develop this second film because of the first that had not given any story to the second film plus I found super incredible liked and recommend seeing Deadpool defeating the bad guys and trying to save a child I only found exaggerated swearing more than just watching away from parents
