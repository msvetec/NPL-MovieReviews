Viewing this film was an experience akin to watching standup comedy  if I hadnt shown up ready to laugh I wouldnt have gotten anything out of it Its so heavily comedic that the action sequences and superhero stuff are almost like icing on a cake  but what genuinely surprised me were the convincing heartfelt moments injected so deftly as to not buzzkill a series of jokes and always giving way to more jokes without altering the total mood
