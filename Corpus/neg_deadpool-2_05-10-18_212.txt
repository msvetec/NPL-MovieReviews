Deadpool 2 is the definition of a hit and miss sequel The opening scene of the film starts things off incredibly strong and the postcredits scene is easily the greatest one thats ever been done but then its a roller coaster of highs and lows for the two hours in between The character of Deadpool is still a joy to watch but some of the creativity and charm feels lost this time around Theres still enough material to work with
