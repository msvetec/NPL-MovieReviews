2018 Movie 74 I guess I really am over the super hero movies I kind of knew I was but I did like the first Deadpool movie and figured this franchise was one of my last hopes to stay semi connected to the genre Ugh I guess it was watchable Thats the best I can say really Had a couple of moments but was mostly just trying way too hard and was far too aware of itself I guess I might still try the Ant Man sequel because Paul Rudd but Deadpool 2 has me pessimistic about that now
