Incredibly funny but exhausting as these things go with me sequel has tons of heart but surprisingly muddled action Clearly the John Wick franchise kept the better action director but the humor and style in this one totally delivers I am impressed that the movie can be half Airplane and half super serious XMen movie and have both halves work This might in fact be my favorite XMen movie
