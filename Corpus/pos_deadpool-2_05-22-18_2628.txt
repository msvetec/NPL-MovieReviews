This ended up being surprisingly random It was not at all what I expected even aside from the purposely misleading advertising Even though it was definitely a comedy there were a lot more serious moments That was weird It felt out of place in a movie like this Especially since even these serious moments have comedy thrown in either with a joke on the side or through the inappropriate soundtrack Yet I feel like theyre still meant to be taken
