I liked Deadpool 2 A lot   The comedy was great and the action was amazing  well thats a given for David Leitch lol I loved Deadpool he was great and Cable and Domino were great too The story was interesting and honestly more grounded than the first movie Deadpool was more serious here and felt more human rather than a joke machine here which I liked His sort of arc was really nice and unexpected Russel was a good character
