I cant begrudge anyone who doesnt like these movies If its not your kind of humor it isnt going to work It works for me though Im not sure there is much more to say about it A lot of the meta jokes are super lowhanging fruit but Im not not going to laugh at a Martha joke at DCs expense Deadpool with baby legs I guess Im five years old
