I really cant fight to hard on this movie It has issues It has major issues It uses references and fan service as a blunt instrument It relies on certain comic book tropes but skewers others Its humor is at times juvenile Its violence is gratuitous and over the top The CG is at times terrible The list goes on and onand you know whatits still funny as fuck There were points in this movie where I literally was seeing stars I was laughing so hard Any movie that has me crying with laughter has succeeded at something no matter its structural or narrative issues
