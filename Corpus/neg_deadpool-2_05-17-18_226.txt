Enjoyed it fractionally more than the first film with some entertaining individual sequences peppered throughout but it remains far too onenote and pleased with itself for my likingÂ It thinks that by being meta that it can excused for a lazy script that bends and adheres to genre conventions far more frequently than it realises Its saying very little actually beyond commenting on the popularity of a genre that eclipses this films own effort
