Better than the first better action  doesnt feel cheap thanks to the bigger budget humor doesnt land most of the time and comes off very obnoxious First act is meh it gets way better when cable shows up Also the emotional scenes feel artificial it doesnt feel earned idk maybe thats just me  If you liked the first youll like this  if you hated the first this isnt going to work for you
