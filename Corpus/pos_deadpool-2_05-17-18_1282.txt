Yeah its wildly reliant on selfreferentialism and its metagimmickry but its still EXTREMELY funny HUGELY entertaining and an improvement on the first film The plot is tracing paper thin but it still manages to contain some emotional weight thatll keep you hooked Undoubtedly the most fun youll have in a cinema this year
