Delivers exactly what you want from a Deadpool movie  big action sequences lots of Rrated jokes selfreferential jokes  but not much else It was a lot of fun it flounders a little when it tries to be serioustouching but mostly delivers what fans want My rating gets dropped a notch due to the amazingly obnoxious couple sitting next to me who felt like a parody of that scene set in a movie theatre in the Scorsese remake of Cape Fear They talked through the whole thing laughed excessively loud repeated all of Reynolds one liners and stated the most obvious revelations at top volume
