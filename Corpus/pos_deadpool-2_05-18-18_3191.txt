SO much fun and some good fuckin friday night entertainment maybe better than the first the only thing is that the softer and more sentimental moments are so out of tone especially for a deadpool movie i mean i 100 understand why theyre there but it just feels disingenuous and almost had me thinking is this supposed to be ironic other than that the action is really excellent intriguing new characters and development for established characters funny as fuck jokes that all hit really well and overall just a good time
