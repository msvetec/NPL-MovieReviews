Not sure why TJ Miller is still in this his part is clearly pared back and he isnt funny and some gags dont land but overall this is a great expansion of everything great about the first one The most surprising thing is that this time there is an actual plot And its a more coherent and well told one than either Black Panther or Infinity War
