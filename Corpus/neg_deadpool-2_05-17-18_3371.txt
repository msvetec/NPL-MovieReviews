Like most sequels to original inventive films this movie misinterprets what was successful in the original If you loved the violence and foul language based comedy in the first Deadpool youll be in heaven But if story and pacing and chemistry are important to you than youll be left with a lot to be desired Its still fun and incredibly funny and enjoyable but definitely not on par with Deadpool Come for the foulmouthed asskicking title character Stay for the greatest post its actually mid credits scene of alltime
