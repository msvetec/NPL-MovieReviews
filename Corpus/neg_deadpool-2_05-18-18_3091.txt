Did you see the first one This is more of the same Unfortunately See it only if you really love the character The story is weak and loosely strung together The CGI is absolute trash in MANY scenes The humor while funny to some is just not my kind of humor The characteristic referential fourthwall breaking humor gets tiring very quickly The overall acting was great however Ryan Reynolds and the rest of the cast put forth their best effort
