Overall great movie completely blew the first one out of the water Only problem is that at some points the comedy was too much Youd be laughing at one joke and then miss the next one Act I was also quite unbalanced Some upsides though it was not as crude as the first one the jokes were more tastefull best Marvel after credits scene ever and a great cameo from Brad Pitt
