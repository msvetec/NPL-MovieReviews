It is the comic book movie we need That one that really distills the genre and calls it on its bullshit Every genre has one Blazing Saddles for Westerns Heathers for Teen Comedies Scream for Slashers and so on and so forth Though I always have the feeling without Ryan Reynolds shtick the Deadpool movies would not be watchable And I say this loving the performances of Brolin Dennison and Beetz Mainly because it would just be a shitty comic
