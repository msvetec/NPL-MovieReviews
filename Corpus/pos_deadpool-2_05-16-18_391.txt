Deadpool 2 lived up to my expectations on every level The tone of this film compared to the first are completely different and I loved the director for doing that This film stands high next to its predecessor while being its own individual film Josh Brolin is amazing as Cable and Ryan Reynolds once again is the mastermind of being the one and only Deadpool
