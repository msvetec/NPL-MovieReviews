Quite honestly I dont remember the first Deadpool much at all but I will never understand why people like these movies Ill give the first one a rewatch just to try to have an open mind and compare it to 2 But to praise this for being meta would be undermining the meta sentiment of any actually good selfreferential movie The meta jokes in it are obvious references to other superheroaction movies with the same actors and directors the guy
