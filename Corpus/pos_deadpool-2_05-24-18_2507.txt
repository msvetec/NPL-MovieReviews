Its so hard for me to declare which Deadpool movie is the best The fist was such a great introduction but Deadpool 2 is an honourable sequel and let me say it they dared so much more with this one and boy if I did like this road Ryan Reynolds shines like a million stars in Wades role just like he was born to play Deadpool seriously let him do it til death We got AMAZING POWERFUL AND WELL WRITTEN
