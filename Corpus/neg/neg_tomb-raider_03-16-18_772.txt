Tomb Raider is a solid start to a hopeful franchise In a world overrun by superheros and Star Wars its nice to return to the cinema to see an oldfashion adventure tale Laura Croft is a great character and a fun one to watch as she solves fun old fashion puzzle pieces The action sequences are nice and Walton Goggins needs to be in everythingÂ
