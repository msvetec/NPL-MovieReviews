I desperately want to give this film a higher rating soley to the fact that Alicia Vikander was in it but I cant seem to overlook the overwhelming amount of plot holes the chaotic camera work and the rigid dialogue Overall Tomb Raider is an entertaining blockbuster with solid acting from Vikander but if you are looking for more than just a popcorn flick Â I suggest you look elsewhere
