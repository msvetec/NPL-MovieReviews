Is it average Sure Is it forgettable Kinda But I still had a good time with Tomb Raider Technically speaking this is probably the best video game movie in terms of quality that weve had so far Vikander is a good Lara Croft and does a great job with what she has She actually sold some of the more dramatic moments in the film The CG is certainly questionable at times and the supporting characters are mainly underused and forgettable but the action is entertaining and the elements they take from the games doesnt feel too pandering or obvious
