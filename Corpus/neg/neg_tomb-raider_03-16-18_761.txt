This film is big and dumb but really entertaining It completely wastes the talents of Alicia Walton and Dominic for thankless roles that they just run around and use little logic I watched the Indiana Jones movies earlier this week and when I watched it bares little resemblance to any of those movies It actually reminds me of the CWs Arrow with all the action taking place on the island and this film not knowing what to do with it Alicia got all buff for this film but if only the film was as dedicated as she is
