An action movie that wants to pace itself by building backstory that ultimately feels just like filler The video game nods were nice to see and subtle which I always appreciate instead of trying to push it as a selling point except the end credits scene which works since its at the end Honestly an average movie throughout but there is one certain plot point midway through that noticeably degraded the movie imo
