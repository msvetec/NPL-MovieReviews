Not all that bad By turns Alicia Vikander grounds and elevates this material Walton Goggins too to a lesser extent The trouble was in the action and set pieces themselves The best of them are quotations and with a couple exceptions the rest are much less coherent Much of the action is obscured spatially and physically and cut through with a moving camera to keep the pace exciting Things dont really get sloppy however until the tomb raiding begins in earnest
