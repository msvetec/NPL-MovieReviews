Tomb Raider met my expectations which is to say short on plot and character long on action The story essentially as with most of these movies is get the MacGuffin with the high point being Alicia Vikander as Lara She must use her brains as well as her brawn to problem solve and Vikander does a good job of showing Lara as confident but also conflicted and not always entirely sure of herself in the midst of all that badassery
