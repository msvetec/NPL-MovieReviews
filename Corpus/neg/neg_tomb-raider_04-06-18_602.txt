I actually really adored the Tomb Raider game that this film is supposedly loosely based upon Tomb Raider sadly is just pretty average I thought Alicia Vikander was brilliant but everything else was just so average The story the stunts the action sequences all so average I did quite like the tomb exploration bits but nothing else particularly stood out as noteworthy A couple of the action sequences were choppily edited and therefore hard to follow and Im just a little disappointed although not surprised that even with excellent source material game still didnt translate well to film
