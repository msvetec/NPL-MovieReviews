I dont like reboots I dont care for remakes either Having said that Alicia Vikander brings a breath of fresh air to this franchise and a realism that goes with it Shes not the untouchable super vixen that Angelina wasThe new Lara Croft is sensitive and fragile but at the same time brave and resourceful Definitely worth your money and time Best Tomb Raider movie so far
