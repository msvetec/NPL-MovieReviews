Dammit this was so close to being good First off Alicia Vikander is a great Lara Croft and I really hope she does another one but she deserves better surroundings I really liked the first 40 min or so but once it got to the stuff with her dad it was all down hill The lighting was strangely dark most of the time some of the happenings on screen were near indistinguishable I feel like the plot was not done
