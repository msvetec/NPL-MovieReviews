The curse of movies based on video games not being any good continues This was so unremarkable that Im already forgetting it as I type this Alicia Vikander did a phenomenal job by getting in shape for the role and doing many of her own stunts She just forgot to play Lara like she had a pulse or personality Ill take Angelina Jolies performance over hers any day
