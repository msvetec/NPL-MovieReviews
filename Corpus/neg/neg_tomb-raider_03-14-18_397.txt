Compared to Angelina Jolies version of Tomb Raider this remake is more serious and darker tone While Angelina Jolie gives us Lara Croft whose sweet sexy and maybe cheesy but Alicia Vikanders Lara is serious stiff and like a teenager who cant control herself Actually I love Daniel Wu and Dominic West performances Walton Goggins as a villain is good but bad screenwriting and maybe directing ruin this movie
