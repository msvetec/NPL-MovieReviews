ive always been an uncharted fan but ive tried tomb raiding a couple of times and its safe to say that this movie captures the essence of the video games in a sweet and touching manner its far from being the worst video game movie ever i mean it does have some amazing action scenes and alicia v  i honestly cant spell her name right if my life depended on it im so sorry  was fun to watch
