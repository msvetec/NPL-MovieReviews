I was thinking of starting my review by saying that the most exciting action was the Premium Rush bike scene at the beginning But actually Its a decent adventure movie I honestly had no expectations and in the end I thought it wasnt bad The story of the film follows a lot of standard tropes but none of it annoyed me It was simple and pretty straightforward Just never becoming anything too convoluted or cheesy It was a pure classical
