Tomb Raider has a good setup solid performances and some intense action sequences however once Lara Croft reaches the island this movie goes downhill fast It gets incredibly monotonous derivative and just stupid I havent played the games so I dont know what they were like and how well this stuck to them but this was not a fun movie to sit through If you like the games youll probably enjoy this but otherwise I dont recommend this at all
