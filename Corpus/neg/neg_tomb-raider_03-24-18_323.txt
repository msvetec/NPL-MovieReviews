The first hour wasnt too bad I really was kinda into it and liked Lara Croft as a character and was interested in where the story would go  but then it gets super predictable which isnt always a problem for me as sometimes the film itself can outshine said predictability  but sadly this time Tomb Raider lives and dies by its script and it dies in the second hour because its just so god damn predictable Estranged fathers
