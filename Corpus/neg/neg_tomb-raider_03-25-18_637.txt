The Indiana Jones films were my favorites to watch as a kid I mustve seenÂ Raiders a good thousand times so naturally I ate all the adventuring and tombraiding up like candy Alicia Vikander was quite good  her talent radiates through the whole movie elevating it a bit The entire thing was unfortunately hampered by the cardboard dialogue and mediocre production design That said the action scenes were exciting and pulsepounding and every time Lara Croft leaps into action the film regains a bit of life
