Ill admit some action scenes kept me on edge but otherwise the movie was filled with illogical decisions and events Too predictable and boring to call it fun action flick Also creators of the movie wanted to tell as so much that even 2 hours seemed too less and very rushed Alicia Vikander was nice as Lara Croft so as a character I really liked her She definitely wasnt the issue with this movie But yet Im not suprised of anything Its not like I was waiting for exceptionally well made movie based on video game
