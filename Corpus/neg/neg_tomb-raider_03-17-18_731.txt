I can honestly say that this is the best video game movie Ive seen Its not amazing but its not complete garbage The plot is predictable the characters are predictable but kinda interesting the villain is just there to move the the plot along Everything was just meh Its not awful but its not fantastic It has a pretty good plot twist at the end and Vikander is a good Lara Croft There is a better cinematic experience of this
