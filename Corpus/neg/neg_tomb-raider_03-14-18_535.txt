Aside from the alright music and Alicia Vikanders performance this film was pretty poor Definitely an attempt to piggyback off of a franchise which is a shame because Tomb Raider as a property has a lot of potential I gave it an extra half star for the inclusion of Walton Goggins if anybody can explain to me whether or not Laras dad was a ghost send me a message
