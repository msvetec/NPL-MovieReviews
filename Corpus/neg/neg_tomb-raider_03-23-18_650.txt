Ive never played a Tomb Raider video game nor have I seen the old Angelina Jolie films So why did I see this film Well I had a few hours to kill before class so I just saw this with Movie Pass cuz there was really nothing else in theaters that I wanted to see Isle of Dogs is still not playing in my area
