A surprisingly entertaining and effective adaptation of the 2013 reboot Vikander captures the vulnerability and intensity of an orphaned heiress who finds herself trapped on a remote island with a band of mercenaries but the film squanders its supporting cast  Walton Goggins most notably The action is frequent and sloppily edited and a dependence on cuts and CGI hampers an otherwise compelling origin narrative Solid but nothing spectacular which at least gives an edge over most video game movies Ill take this over Angies original Tomb Raider any day
