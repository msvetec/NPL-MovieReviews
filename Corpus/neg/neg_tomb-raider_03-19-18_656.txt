I was quite happy for Alicia Vikanders youthful performance as Lara Croft and especially so in the action scenes where she perfectly emulated a human being in veritable distress The film however despite being clearly made in good faith and having few but inspired moments of photographic and narrative awe came around as negatively na√Øve letting in several unreasonable andor unjustified screenwriting choices that undermined a great deal the effectiveness of the story and of nearly all of the characters
