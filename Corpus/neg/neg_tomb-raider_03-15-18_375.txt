The best one ofthese even though its not particularly good OR bad Alicia Vikanders physicality and quality performance is the anchor to this tonally inconsistent and mediocre story that almost derails about an hour in Theres a couple set pieces that impress and Roar Uthaug makes it well known that he wants to make a Premium Rush sequel early on I wouldnt recommend seeing it in theaters but if you want a Redbox rental for the night grab a couple beers and plop down with a bowl of chips for a slick hour and 40 minutes
