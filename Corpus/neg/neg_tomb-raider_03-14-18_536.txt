Sadly the film doesnt offer anything new to the Actonadventure genre everything that happens weve seendone better in other films Thankfully its better than the recent dreadful Assassins Creed film Yes its watchable and at times enjoyable but thats as far as it goes It matches the origin routes of the new reboot games with LOTS and LOTS of jumping running shooting arrows and general Croftyness Keep expectations low and youll prob enjoy it too but this isnt the film to brake the game to movie curse 5 pick axes out of 5
