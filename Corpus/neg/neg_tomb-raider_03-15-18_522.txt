A pretty decent video game adaptation with strong cast and fine plot Yes it is less based and more copied from the games reboot also named TOMB RAIDER Some cutscenes from the game were recreated for the movie almost shotbyshot But TOMB RAIDER is still a decent picture Alicia Vikander is awesome as the main protagonist while Walton Goggins makes a fine villain Im amazed of just how many incarnations of Boyd Crowder Goggins can fit into Hollywood pictures in
