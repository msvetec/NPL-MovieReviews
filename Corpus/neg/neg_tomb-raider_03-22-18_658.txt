This movie is basically your standard action adventure film youve seen a bazillion times The only thing that shines about this movie is Alicia Vikander who I thought did a great job I am actually giving this movie a half star for Vikanders performance alone Other than that it was decently entertaining though it was a two hour movie that felt like three This movie doesnt pack as much of a punch as it could have Though it might be the best video game adaptation Ive seen in a while
