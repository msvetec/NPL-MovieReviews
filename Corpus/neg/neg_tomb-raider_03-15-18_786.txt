The new Tomb Raider is the best Tomb Raider movie ever made which admittedly isnt saying much A reboot of the film franchise based on the reboot of the game franchise it stars an excellent Alicia Vikander as a younger less experienced less battle hardened Lara Croft which certainly makes for a more relatable character than Angelina Jolies ice queen The story is simple but effective the action scenes are exciting and while its never going to be mistaken for a Great Film its dense jungles mysterious tombs and ancient death traps give it the right sense of fun and adventure
