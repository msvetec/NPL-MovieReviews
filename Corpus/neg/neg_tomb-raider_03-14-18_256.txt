A weird and probably misguided attempt to bootstrap a new franchise which they should have named Lara Croft Begins Vikander pulls out all the stops with an almost comically emotive performance which sadly remains trapped inside an otherwise totally generic 1990s actionadventure movie I mean if youre going to do a realistic Tomb Raider movie WHY CAST WALTON GOGGINS AS THE VILLAIN He doesnt even get to chew the scenery even once At least it will piss of those pathetic male gamers who would claim sole ownership of mediocre but kind of sympathetic stuff like this
