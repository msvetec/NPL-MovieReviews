Im pretty easy to please when it comes to treasure hunt movies so I had a pretty good time with Tomb Raider The film had some pretty nice visuals and some cool action setpieces that kept me mostly entertained throughout Biggest issue with the movie is that it doesnt spend the time to really invest you in the characters emotional arcs or intrigue of the story choosing instead to move briskly from one action scene to another
