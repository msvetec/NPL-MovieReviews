While a predictable story and some questionable CGIcamera work pull it down Tomb Raider is a fun actionadventure film that isnt without its charms I wish I felt more drawn to the side characters and that the Lara vs the Island aspect had been more prevalent it does what it needs to in this limiting run time decent enough Im excited to see where this potential series will go and if theyll move into their own storyline or keep readapting the games source material
