Tomb Raider is just as dumb and ridiculous as I thought it would be but the amount of respect that the film pays to the video games is something that I really admire Alicia Vikander is a great Lara Croft full of emotion and physicality The supporting acting ranges from decent to pretty bad The action scenes are a lot of fun especially one that feels like it was pulled directly from a stealth mission from the games The story
