Solid movie Better than the Jolie movies Hopefully this makes enough to warrent another movie as the set up has me intrigued Hopefully under different direction and R rated  Vikander is fine in the role given the material Do kind of wish Walton Goggins was allowed to go bigger as the villain If he were allowed to ham it up more hed be a better villain
