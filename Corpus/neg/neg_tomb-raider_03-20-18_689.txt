It seems Alicia Vikander can play every character and even as Lara Croft shes perfect Its not her fault that this movie is extremely conventional in every way Its well done but a few fresh ideas wouldnt have done no harm It felt like Ive seen films like this a million times and there was nothing about it that could surprise me in any way Thats ok but Alicia wouldve deserved better
