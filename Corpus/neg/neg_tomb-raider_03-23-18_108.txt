A pretty solid and faithful video game adaptation It takes a little while to get going has some plot holes that really bugged me and despite a solid performance from Walton Goggins has a really weak villain but I honestly had fun The action is entertaining once the island is introduced the rest of the film flies by and Alicia Vikander is pretty much perfect casting for Lara Croft Its nothing all that special but Id certainly be down for a sequel
