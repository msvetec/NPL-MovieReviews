okay so this movie was fun but i have to say i am so tired of seeing men treat lara croft as if she is only a sex symbol and couldnt be anything more than that i mean over the past week ive seen PROFESSIONAL critics say this movie is bad because alicia isnt angelina and therefore doesnt look as attractive as THEY want lara to be nevermind the fact that alicia is a gorgeous girl and looks close enough
