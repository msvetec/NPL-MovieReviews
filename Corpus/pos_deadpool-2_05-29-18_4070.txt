On second veiwing it doesnt exactly compare it is a comedy through and through so when you know the jokes it can be less fun That being said Im still totally blown away by the emotional maturity in it The movie definetly knows when to stay in the moment rather then reaching for a punch line to the point where I still get a little chocked up at the ending Its like a 42 out of 5
