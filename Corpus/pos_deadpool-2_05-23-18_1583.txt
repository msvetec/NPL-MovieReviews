Usually when I watch a Marvel film or any superhero film for that matter Im looking at a few things to critique the narrative the visuals and the entertainment value Generally unless something goes horribly wrong the majority of blockbusters have strong technical aspects sound production design etc so I dont delve into those in my reviews unless its a film like A Quiet Place where sound design is an essential aspect of the film
