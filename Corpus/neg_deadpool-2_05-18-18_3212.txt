Enjoyed it a little more than the original despite having a very similar reaction Mostly good chuckles maybe a couple laughs In my opinion Deadpool humor works fine in doses but an entire film Sometimes the humor wore thin on me I guess its not my cup of tea generally speaking That being said Id be lying if I said I didnt have fun I wouldnt mind seeing it again once FX starts airing it
