Either David Leitsch hasnt seen the first Deadpool or he didnt understand what he was looking at This is a major  and predictable  miscalculation by Ryan Reynolds and Fox proof positive that they have no idea how to run a superhero franchise As if XMen Origins Wolverine wasnt enough Deadpool learns what its like to find a family Unironically This was 90 minutes of me shifting uncomfortably in my seat
