Yeah I cant say too much without spoiling this but the humor mostly comes fast and furious Theres more heart here than the first I still havent decided if thats good or not But I was definitely crying from laughter On the action side they upped the ante with bigger set pieces but at the expense of the smaller closequarters Â combat of the first All in all I enjoyed it immensely and will definitely watch again
