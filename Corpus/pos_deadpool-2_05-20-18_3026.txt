While not as good as the original Deadpool 2 still manages to a solid sequel The jokes were really good and the action was really solid The 4th wall jokes were good though some of them were a bit distracting The story had a surprising amount of heart to it which I appreciated Parts of it did feel a bit underwhelming but I still cared and had a really good time
