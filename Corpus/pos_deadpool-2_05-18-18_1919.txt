While it falls flat in many departments resulting in a severe lack of consistency throughout Deadpool 2 succeeds in being more fastpaced frenetic and larger in scope than its predecessor It feels a lot less restrained than the original and once it finds its groove after the sloppy first act it provides an incredibly fun time If you werent a fan of the original though this probably wont win you over
