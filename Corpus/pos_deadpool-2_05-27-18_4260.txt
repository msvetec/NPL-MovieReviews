I really enjoyed this movie I was laughing for 80 of the movie The comedic timing is perfect That being said I felt that the story just wasnt there Now in my opinion Deadpool was a never a story driven movie but thats a big deal to me The jokes can only take you so far there has to be strong plot details as well Yes Deadpool has motivation throughout the movie Im not really talking about his character mainly
