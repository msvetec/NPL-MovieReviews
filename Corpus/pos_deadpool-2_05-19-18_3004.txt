Deadpool 2 is funnier and more refined than its original and true to its metahumour really uses its trailer to make its film funnier Its jokes are rarely not funny and my personal favourites were the missable but numerous instances in which Russell played by Julian Dennison calls some of his lines from Hunt for the Wilderpeople almost word to word throughout the film It has good action and one of its villain may be the product of terrible CGI
