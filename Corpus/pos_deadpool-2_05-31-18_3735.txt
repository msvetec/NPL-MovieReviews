Although it took a while for this movie to get going for me once it did I was into it Its amazing at how the superhero genre is simultaneously being blatantly made fun of while also achieving all the common story beats along the way Its what makes this such a great parody in that it knows what the audience expects in this type of movie it makes injokes to make the audience feel like a part of the process
