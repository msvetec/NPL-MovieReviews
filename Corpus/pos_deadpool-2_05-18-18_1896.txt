Its better than the first and thats something of an accomplishment considering how much of hype this film had I mean wow I had a really fun time watching this film from start to finish I was laughing and laughing I think the XForce and the end credits are the best They really upped the budget and it shows the cinematography is so much better the cgi is improved and the action scenes are just the best I prefer Thanos to Cable but Josh Brolin was fun enough that I enjoyed him All in all not the best superhero film but one of the most enjoyable
