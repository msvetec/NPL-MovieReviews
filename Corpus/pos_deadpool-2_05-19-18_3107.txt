Some thoughts much better than the first one lots more jokes about the MCU and DCEU which I loved feels much more genuine than the first one It feels like a movie with some heart rather than Ryan Reynolds doing standup for 2 hours I love Domino so so so much Brolin as Cable was great possibly the funniest midcredits scene Ive ever seen
