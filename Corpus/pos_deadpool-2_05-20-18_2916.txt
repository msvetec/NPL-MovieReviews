Ryan Reynolds really outdid the first movie It was funny action packed and kept it real to the max The same humor we loved in the first one times two He really didnt shy from the crudeness and disturbing nature of Deadpool They brought it all out I loved it and Id recommend to anyone who was a fan of the first Lot of great supporting actors and actresses A in my book
