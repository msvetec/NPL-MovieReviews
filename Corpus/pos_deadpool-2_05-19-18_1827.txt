A sequel thats better than the first and does more unique and different executions to an already interesting story Deadpool 2 dives into the predictable superhero movie tropes and dissects it in a way thats both subtle and refreshing Only issues would be that some jokes felt Like they just wanted to reference a random thing just for the sake of naming a random movie ItsÂ like me mentioning the terminator in a conversation for no apparent reason Overall Deadpool 2 is a perfect sequel that stands out and makes The biggest superhero blockbusters look boring in comparison
