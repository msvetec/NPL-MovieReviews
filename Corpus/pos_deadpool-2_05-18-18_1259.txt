I could not quite get fully on board with the 2016 film Deadpool and I cannot get fully on board with its new sequel Deadpool 2 For me these movies are the cinematic equivalent of walking through a Spencers Gifts store at the local mall The jokes and gags are just raunchy enough to shock someones elderly grandparents but theres a cheaply generic brand marketing predictability to the end result
