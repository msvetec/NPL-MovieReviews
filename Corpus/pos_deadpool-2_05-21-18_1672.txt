Both better and worse than the first movie While the first movie had better pacing and felt more natural in its origin story plot the sequel comes across as bloated and almost episodic in its construction Despite that I found Deadpool 2s even looser and more freewheeling sense of humor much funnier than the first Also the simple romance at the heart of Deadpool felt more authentic than what 2 was attempting with Firefist and Cable
