Id be damned Deadpool 2 is indeed a family movie A lot of references can be easily missed if people arent familiar with them and frankly I got bored at some point as the neverending jokes can be a bit exhausting Nevertheless as expected it is so much fun and it showcases great humor and action sequences even managed to keep a few delightful surprises
