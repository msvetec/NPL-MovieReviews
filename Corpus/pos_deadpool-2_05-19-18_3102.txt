Rating 810 This sequel at his first vision turns out not to be at the qualitative levels of his predecessor one of my favorite movies on superheroes but still manages to make people laugh and entertain Excellent new characters but above all excellent are the evolutions of those already present which make them even more interesting and important participating more for the purposes of history What the film has not convinced me was the CGI which is good but sometimes it is really mediocre almost as if the film was from 2012 Overall the film is a great successor of Deadpool 2016 that does not disappoint
