Better than the first movie and a fun time overall The second act was a bit of a slog but I think thats mainly because Deadpool isnt a great character in isolation Hes a lot more fun when given the chance to play off of other characters instead of just winking at the camera so the new additions were welcome Id be down for a Domino solo film honestly The humor still didnt always land but it had more laughs than the first and an overall more interesting story
