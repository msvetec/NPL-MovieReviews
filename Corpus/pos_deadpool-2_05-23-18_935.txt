I expected Deadpool 2 to be very good but not THIS good before I begin this is a no spoiler review so dont worry about any spoilers Once again Ryan Reynolds shows he was born to play Deadpool the first movie proved he was Deadpool and this movie proves it even more Josh Brolin was a really great casting choice as Cable I was a little worried he was going to come off as a typical big guy with guns
