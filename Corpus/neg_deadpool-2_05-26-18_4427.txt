Basically all the dialogue in this movie is like a 13 year who just learned how to swear Because everyone knows Deadpool is such a vulgar character they really went with that but way over the top So much that it takes away the comedy from the movie The action scenes were great some good characters introduced but also some terrible characters TJ Millers character lacked that funnyness he had in the first movie and the role they gave Dopinder the cab driver was useless and not funny Overall entertaining but definitely not as good as the first
