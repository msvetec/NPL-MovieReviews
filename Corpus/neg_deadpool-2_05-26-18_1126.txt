While I appreciate the well done action sequences and performances of Reynolds and Brolin I thought the film was okay I didnt laugh out loud like I was expecting I had a couple chuckles You can tell Fox allowed a bigger budget and it shows giving this film a more crisp and cleaner look than the first Its a fine film for fans of Deadpool and his humor
