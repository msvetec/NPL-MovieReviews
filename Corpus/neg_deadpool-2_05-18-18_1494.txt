Better than the first but only because it functions more as a coherent film If youve seen the first film you know what to expect grossout humor breaking the fourth wall and a ton of violence This movie succeeds where the original largely fails by focusing on Deadpools relationships with people around him I think he just works better as a character surrounded by more straightlaced individuals and that makes me feel excited for a possible XForce picture
