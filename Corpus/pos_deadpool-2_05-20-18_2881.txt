For awhile about every 20th joke lands which since theres about 20 jokes a minutes isnt too bad  But rarely has a film rallied so hard in the last 30 minutes  For the first time something feels at stake the jokes start to feel kinetic and Deadpool 2 may go down in history as the first film to slay the after the credits sequence
