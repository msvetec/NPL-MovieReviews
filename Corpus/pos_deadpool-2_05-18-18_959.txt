The level of comedic intelligence present in Deadpool 2 cannot be overstated Equally incredible is the way that its comedy is woven into the narrative and not once disrupts the tone This movie is hilarious and action packed but more importantly it has an emotional core a soul All my assumptions about it were 100 wrong In my eyes a mustsee and it makes the first film look mediocre in comparison
