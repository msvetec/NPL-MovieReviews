I enjoyed Deadpool 2 more than I thought I would its probably because my expectations were so unbelievably low that I found myself chuckling at some parts of the movie Id also say that this was better than the first Deadpool despite knowing exactly what kinds of things to expect from this sequel I felt like there was a better focus on one singular story and the characters were used well enough to get by Like the first film there
