If you liked the 1st you would definitely live the sequel With a lot pressure to succeed where most sequels fail Deadpool 2 nailed it The amount of humor and laughter i got was too much that my ribs kinda hurt It also had good action scenes and hearty moments In terms of entertainment value it is on par or better than AvengersIW which I did not expect Ryan Reynolds is just born to play Deadpool
