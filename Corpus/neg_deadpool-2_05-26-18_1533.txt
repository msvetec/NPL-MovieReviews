Thats just lazy writing                                     After watching Deadpool 2 I left the cinema very disappointed and unsatified The first instalment was critical and commercial success and was beloved by many audiences I find the film to be overrated but still competently made and comedic I didnt expect much for this sequel I went in with low expectations although I had one expectation to laugh The film gave me no more than six chuckles not one single laugh This was very disappointing
