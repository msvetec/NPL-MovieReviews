This film is fine The cast is very funny and the dynamic between Ryan Reynolds and Josh Brolin is a highlight There are also multiple twists and turns that provided for great laughsÂ  However the film feels a bit fatigued The first act is incredibly rushed and the third act while trying to riff on horribly boring drawn out endings falls into that trap itself There is also a twist before the opening credits which tries to have it both ways the film plays it for laughs and as an emotional core giving those sections of the movie a mixed emotional core
