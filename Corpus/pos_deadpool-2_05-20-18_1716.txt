Deadpool 2 is just as enjoyable as the first film and I mean that in every possible sense While its biggest fault is still having a generic story trading the origin story for essentially Terminator 2 it again makes up for that with its sharp humor visual flair and an ensemble of committed performances It also adds depth to Deadpools character without taking too much away from his snarky appeal
