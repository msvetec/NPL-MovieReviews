Looking at both Deadpool and Deadpool 2 its clear that they are both completely different  minus the fourthwall breaking titular character Whilst the story is simple and told in a nonlinear fashion with the first Deadpool the sequel often feels convoluted as theres way too much packed into the 2hour runtime making the film feel overlong on many occasions Deadpool 2 increases the jokes and humour with there being a lot of humour and superhero injokes that I enjoyed
