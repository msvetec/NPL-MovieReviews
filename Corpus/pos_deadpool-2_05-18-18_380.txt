I really liked this a little more than the first Deadpool 2 is far from perfect but its a really good time Ryan Reynolds is such a perfect Deadpool and I hope when the XMen migrate to the MCU they keep him as the Merc with mouth I loved the newcomers too Zazie Beetz as Domino and Josh Brolin as Cable were perfect and I hope they keep them in the roles as well My problems with the film start
