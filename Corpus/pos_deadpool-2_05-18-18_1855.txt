Oh man this was a helluva lot of fun This one works a lot better than the first one really pushing the envelope in terms of violence and crude humor  and it tells a better story as well Although now that I know the term fridging I wish the treatment of some of the female characters was better But Domino is awesome the action is great and this might be the funniest movie of the year so far  the midfilm MacGruberesque X Force scene is a true highlight This would be a great watch at home with several beers
