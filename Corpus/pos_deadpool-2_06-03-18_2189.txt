Had to watch it again because the first time was just a bad experience for no reason I know this is honestly a really good movie and I love it it has a different focus to the first one while keeping the same feeling I dont think I mean feeling but Ill go with it Doesnt drag on entertaining the whole way through Mid credit scene was absolutely worth it
