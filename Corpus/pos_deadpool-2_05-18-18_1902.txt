The original felt like it was missing something in my eyes and the sequel absolutely delivers on what I wanted from the original The writing is better the humor is better the action is better and just pretty much everything else is better The only thing the original does better than the sequel is the romance story between Wade and Vanessa Deadpool is given the freedom to do whatever he wants now and the writers take full advantage of that
