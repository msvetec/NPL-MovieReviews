Returning to the titular role Ryan Reynolds is as good as he was in the first film He has completely embodied the role of Deadpool The problem isnt with him its with the rest of the movie It draws various narrative threads from its comic book source material and merges them together in the most haphazard way None of the emotional notes connected with me which is a big problem given that a huge theme of this movie was family
