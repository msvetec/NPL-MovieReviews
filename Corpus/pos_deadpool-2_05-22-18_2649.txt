Deadpool 2 is a solid sequel and a good time at the movies The Merc With The Mouth is still funny violent and irreverant The returning cast is good though I could have used more of Negasonic Newcomers Brolin as Cable Beetz as Domino and Dennison as Russell are very welcome with Dennison getting a breakout role in a big movie Its disposable but how could Deadpool 2 not be I had a good time Im looking forward to an XForce movie and I wont say no to a Deadpool 3 either
