I dont think a lot of the comedy in the Deadpool movies is for me maybe it would have been in the 90s when I was younger and super into Deadpool but David Leitch is a breath of fresh air for the franchise The action is considerably better a bunch of the more grisly jokes defintiely land and theres one sequence that may be one of the ballsiest Ive ever seen in a franchise blockbuster Youll know it when you see it
