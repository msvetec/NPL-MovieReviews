While I definitely liked this one better than the first one my feelings are a little more complex I found it funnier though its still not my favorite style of humor What made it better than the first one was that instead of laughing like 1520 of the time I laughed maybe 30 of the time Most of the jokes are forced and simple almost feeling obligatory and embarrassing sometimesÂ
