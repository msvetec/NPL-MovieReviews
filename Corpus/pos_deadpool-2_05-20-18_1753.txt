I really enjoyed Deadpool 2 and absolutely loved the brilliant sequences and the many many many jokes throughout I especially thought that Domino was a really great addition to the movie and her fight scenes I thought were so clever and entertaining Also the portrayal of Juggernaut was perfect and was great to see compared to the embarrassment of X3 as well as all the other supporting characters Cable Russell Colossus being perfectly performed as great additions to the story
