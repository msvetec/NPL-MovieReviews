I would call the Deadpool films guilty pleasures but that wouldnt be fair to how much love is put into these films by its terrific team and cast This sequel manages to be even more exhaustingly funny than the first and a high octane blast The only thing that gets in its way of it being truly special is a weakness I thought I would never see clichés Deadpool 2 indulges in turning clichés on their heads and embracing them
