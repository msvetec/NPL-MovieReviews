Im a little conflicted on this movie I am outright repulsed by TJ Millers mere presence in it disturbed by how an innocent stuntwoman died shooting a scene that isnt even in the finished film and distressed by the screenwriters thinking it necessary to fridge a great character only to feign ignorance about the subject later With all that said despite several cringeworthy lines and some noticeably bad CG I fucking loved every minute of this stupid vulgar immature piece
