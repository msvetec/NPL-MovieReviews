I never got around to watching the first one because I thought I only cared about Deadpool in relation to SpiderMan but This movie was just fun and hilarious to me The theatre vibe was great and we all laughed so much I cant remember the last time I laughed out loud in a theatre so genuinely Is it perfect No But it was wildly entertaining
