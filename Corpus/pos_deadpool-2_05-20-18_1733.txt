I think I liked this more than the first one  My Comic Book fanboy was awakened more than usual  When deduced who the big monster was because of the presence of another character I got overly excited  Hows that for spoiler language gymnastics I was one of two people in my theatre who laughed at a jab at Rob Leifield  The XForce stuff was pretty great and Domino was near perfect
