I loved the first Deadpool film and Im happy to say this is a case of the sequel being even better than the original All the meta jokes fourth wall breaks and action are turned up a few notches At times its also a really serious movie about love loss abuse and identity Ryan Reynolds really is a funny person and it shines through here The rest of the cast is great too and I really hope we get a third movie with them all returning
