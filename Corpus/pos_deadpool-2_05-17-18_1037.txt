The script was better finetuned than the first in my opinion and most of the fun actually happens after the teamup closer to the third act  The selfaware humor may seem less novel and more of the same from the first but boy it sure was entertaining featuring some laughoutloud moments in the second half  Domino steals her scenes and make sure you stick around for a midcredit scene that was just golden
