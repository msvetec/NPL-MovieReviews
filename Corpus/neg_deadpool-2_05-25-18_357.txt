Deadpool 2 is a really fun summer movie thats just as good as the first Its tighter in action and humor but the heart of the first isnt entirely her along with a much more convoluted plot Reynolds grounds it in his excellent portrayal of the Merc with a Mouth and Beetz and Dennison are inspired additions to the franchise Brolins Cable has disappointingly littler to do than expected but hopefully hell have a bigger role the next goaround Leitchs
