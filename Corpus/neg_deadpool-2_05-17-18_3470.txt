Maybe my hopes were too high Maybe Ill like it better on a rewatch I laughed out loud a lot yet so very many jokes didnt stick the landing I felt disappointed Some of the CGI work reminded me of the rhinos on Wakanda  a little cheap looking with animation too fast to look believable Or maybe Im disappointed because Negasonic Teenage Warhead is sidelined to the point of almost being a noncharacter I dunno Ill watch it again and hope I like it more on a second viewing
