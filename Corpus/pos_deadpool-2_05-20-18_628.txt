This was so much better than the first The humour hits Its actually emotional in places Possibly my favourite end credits scene of all time Some of the meta humour really wasnt to my taste mainly the universebreaking metahumour is problematic for me as opposed to haha DC is shit metahumourÂ Not sure I really want to see another one despite how much I liked this one I feel like if they keep going itll definitely lose its charm Still good laughs some truly gruesome fun to be had
