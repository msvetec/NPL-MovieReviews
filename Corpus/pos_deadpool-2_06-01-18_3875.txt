It was okay Compared to Deadpool 1 this was not as good The reason being is that in this film many jokes and fourth wall breaking were done very on purpose And made more important While fourth wall breaking is one of Deadpools characteristics I felt it removed from his natural humor since he talked to us rather than a character in the shot The jokes were also made for the sake of a joke rather than feeling like it
