Not the movie I was expecting but Deadpool 2 manages to retain the wisecracking persona of the titular character while also bringing some real gravitas to its story Theres a ton of great humor but this feels more like the XMen movie we never got From the beginning the concept of the XMen has always been a metaphor for racial inequality and was later broadened to encompass all types of marginalized people That it took this long for those themes
