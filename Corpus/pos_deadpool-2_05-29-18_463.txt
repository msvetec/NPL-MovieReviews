I enjoyed the first one It wasnt a movie I rewatch a lot of but I was entertained good laughs and cool action I have the exact same feelings towards this one I do like what is done as filmmaking goes Just seemed like a blast to make Had a lot of fun poking fun at movies The cast all does fine Ryan Reynolds truly is the perfect choice The new additions are cool Really loved Josh Brolin and Zazie
