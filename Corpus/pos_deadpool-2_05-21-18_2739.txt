I thought the jokes landed better and the plot made more sense than Deadpool Ryan Reynolds is still perfect for Deadpool and Josh Brolin absolutely walked the line of the tone of the film vs Cable as a character I still thought the visuals of the movie were a little bland TJ Millers awful character got pigeonholed into his worst joke Overall I really enjoyed the movie
