I think Deadpool is a great character But in this and the first film I wanted him to go further push deeper and darker into the meta But maybe thats asking something of the character thats not been there in the comics I dont know Also this is a surprisingly bleak film when you pull away the anarchic glitter Loses his wife as does Cable is suicidal and actually achieves it by the end and theres child abuse Kinda bummed me out a bit by the end
