Better than the first in every single way Deadpool 2 is a lot funnier than the first with a surprising heart and weight you probably might not expect David Leitchs action and visual sensibilities blended well with Ryans style and voice Actors were perfectly cast there was a flow whenever they interacted with each other Story was pretty solid Overall it was a good sequel that I thoroughly enjoyed
