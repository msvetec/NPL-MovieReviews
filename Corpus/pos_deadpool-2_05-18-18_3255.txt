Look I had a fun time Im not going to say I didnt I laughed A LOT So many jokes landed The XForce scene was fantastic The ending was great It wasnt as predictable as I thought But it was really cliched and the first act was almost unbearably slow On the same level as the first for me Reynolds absolutely kills it as Deadpool
