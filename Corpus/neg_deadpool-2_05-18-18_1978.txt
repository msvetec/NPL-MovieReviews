It was fine I dunno I feel like it had a lot to live up to and Im not sure the sequel really brought anything new to the table Was fun I laughed quite a bit But the emotional stuff just didnt land for me Was also fun that the theatre cheered when New Zealand was mentioned but we do that for everything so nothing new there either
