I like this about as much as the first Slight edge to the first simply because I thought it was funnier It felt more fresh and unexpected but now this is what we all have come to expect from a Deadpool movie Cable and Domino were both great and I think each act gets progressively better After the fun opening scene I was a bit worried as the jokes were just not landing some of them very cringey but luckily
