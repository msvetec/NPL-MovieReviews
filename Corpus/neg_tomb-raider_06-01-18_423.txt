I really wanted this movie to be good but it didnt delivered at all  So many differences from the original game made it hard to watch  There were so many good quality elements from the personality of Lara Croft missing from the game that could make this movie much better  I dont understand what the writers were thinking hidding all this stuff But If you see it like a simple action movie you might like it but as a Tomb Raider not even close
