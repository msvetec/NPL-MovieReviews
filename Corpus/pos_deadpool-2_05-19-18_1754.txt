Enjoyed this a lot 1st ones story was somewhat typical superhero saves girlfriend whereas 2nd one is more superhero vs antihero Less predictable than 1st Just as funny as 1st but more references to other films Some scenes really hilarious Loved all the supporting characters especially Rob Delaney as Peter Id definitely see 2nd time
