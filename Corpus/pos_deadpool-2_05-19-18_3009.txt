Deadpool 2 is the music video version of the first Its far less concerned with plot and romance and instead spends its time being absolutely absurd in every way from start to finish instead of in parts like its predecessor This is a sequel that knows EXACTLY what kinds of antics fans of the character are there for and throws it at them with no break for two hours Im conflicted because on a technical level its a worse film
