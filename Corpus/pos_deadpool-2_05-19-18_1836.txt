Deadpool 2 is an excellent sequel that is very much in keeping with the spirit of the original while also expanding on what made the first one such a fun experience Once again Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing Deadpool and really makes this film The entertainment and hilarious film that it is The humor is very similar to the previous Deadpool movie which in my book is a good thing But this film also had a pretty compelling story to go along with it and it helps make this an overall fun and enjoyable experience
