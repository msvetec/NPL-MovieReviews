actually had a little bit of fun with this stupid shitty film way better than the first but still probably doesnt even deserve the rating im giving it edit wanted to say about this cause cant stop thinking about this the take on me scene was surpisingly really moving kinda cheesy but surprisingly well done for a DEADPOOL film
