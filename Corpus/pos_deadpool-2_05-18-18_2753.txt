I was lukewarm at best on the first Deadpool film when I watched it a few weeks ago so I wasnt sure if there was any hope for this sequel However Deadpool 2 improved on the original in almost every way imaginable For one thing this movie takes the fourthwall breaking and selfreferential humor to another level It seems there isnt a single scene that goes by where he isnt referencing something outside of this movie Im sure this will
