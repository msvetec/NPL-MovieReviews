Deadpool 2 was as fun as I was expecting it to be and even more It was full of pop culture references and its typical humor there were times were the jokes delivered and there were times were they hit and missed Ryan Reynolds shines through this he was meant for this role This is still a romance movie if you believe it or not and sometimes it takes the romance too far It has its weaknesses and all but still makes for a very entertaining movie And its gayer So much gayer And for that just a tad better than the first
