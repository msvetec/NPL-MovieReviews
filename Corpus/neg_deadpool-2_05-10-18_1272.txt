I like the sincerity of this one a lot more than I like the jokes After the first film almost all of Reynolds punchlines have become predictable and sometimes grating There are some laughs though and Beetz Dennison and Brolin are perfect additions Also nearly every set piece in this one is recycled from the first film large scale car chase climactic melee with all characters involved Meh Its fine I guess
