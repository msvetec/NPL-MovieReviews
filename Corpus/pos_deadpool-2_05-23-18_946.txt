Loved pretty much every second of this movie There might be some mistakes here or there but the movie is so much fun that I either didnt notice or didnt care I think this one is done so much better than the first which I still really enjoy but Ive never felt tue desire to rewatch This movie I wouldnt mind seeing again right now
