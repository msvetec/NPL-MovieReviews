Deadpool 2 dials it up to eleven in some of the best ways possible Great action great laughs and an all around balls to the wall fun time Everyone shines and has there place in the film There is plenty of surprises for fans of the first film and comic book fans In my opinion its better than its predecessor by delivering more of what fans loved about the first film Some jokes run a bit too long and the visual effects are noticeable at times But these few problems can easily be overlooked Loved it from start to finish
