jesus how many mcu jokes can there be i liked this movie it was fun and ryan reynolds dry sexual humor works but after a while the jokes and the hinted bisexuality of deadpool got a lil old colossus is one of the best characters and negesonic teenage warheads girlfriend was a perfect casting choice overall would recommend to a friend
