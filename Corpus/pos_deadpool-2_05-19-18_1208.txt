Im glad I got to see this with a pack of friends  Very funny funnier than the original but I think I just like the first one more bc i cunt believe the amount of unnecessary violence it was so gross I had to look away a few times but its cool to see an R rated hero movie  Domino was the best character introduced So bad ass Not enough Negasonic warhead though I love my lesbians   They could have made the little kid more like able but whatever  This movie was also a bit emotional I welled up a lot
