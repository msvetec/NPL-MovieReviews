What a odd sequel It still had all the joke bits and metacommentary which is juuuuust beginning to get old but also packed in a bunch of messy melodrama They kill off the girlfriend who was the saving grace of the first film make jokes about it while also having it be an actual plot point and character development thing But no meta joke about films using Dead Women as character building points for male protagonists In any case it was funny if a tad bloated
