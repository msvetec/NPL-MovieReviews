I laughed but still suffers from the same problem the original has where the supporting cast just isnt as entertaining as you really wantNEED them to be This one works even less in that department and personally found it not as strong humorwise and definitely all over the place as a narrative Still this is Ryan Reynolds movie and hes great and takes a lot of fun jabs so if you enjoy him youll enjoy this
