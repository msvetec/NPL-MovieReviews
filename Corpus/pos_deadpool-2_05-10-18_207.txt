THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE actually kinda loved it Maybe even more than 1 Goes balls out and it actually works Anyway why were we all freaking outconcerned about this also Leitchs action and visual style  the first as good as Millers was just more up my street They are really taking advantage of amped up scale and budget Again honestly better than the first For me anyway Comes down to the scale not being constrained by origin story and the style for me
