Maybe not a popular opinion but I enjoyed this movie way more than the first one Some jokes didnt land and it looks like half the CG was from a 2009 video game but it was enjoyable Brolin was really good as Cable everybodys acting was fine Soundtrack was pretty good Using ahas acoustic Take On Me was a nice touch
