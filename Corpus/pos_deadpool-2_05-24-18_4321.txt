To be frank I didnt have that much expectations going into this movie  I felt that this is one of those movies that doesnt need a sequel The first one couldve been a good standalone movie I felt that coming out with a second one was just another typical blockbuster cashgrab move With that said I still enjoyed it  definitely wasnt as good as the first one but I still had a few good laughs
