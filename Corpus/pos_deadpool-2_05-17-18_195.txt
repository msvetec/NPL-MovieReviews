Maybe less of a plot than the first but do you know what really enjoyed it thoroughly funny great comic timing from Ryan Reynolds and a real commitment to the role with the ability to completely take the piss out of himself and not take himself too seriously which is exactly whats needed to make this film and franchise a success Tonnes of cultural references in comic parts without feeling gratuitous or overboard with the classic fourth wall breaking on full display New characters in the series breathe extra life into it too as well as those retained from the previous outing
