Good action sloppy writing boring plot I feel like the hype for Deadpool movies has come and gone very quickly Brolin looks amazing as Cable but I think hes bored in the movie and thats kinda sad Nobody else should ever be DP besides Ryan but theres not a lot in DP2 that wasnt done better in the first movie
