Deadpool 2 is decent but I unfortunately wouldnt say that it comes even close to the quality of the first one While the film made me laugh out loud multiple times and had me really invested in the character the story this time around felt very rushed and almost felt as if the company was more interested in creating a franchise rather than a good movie Again thats not to say that Deadpool 2 isnt good which it is but
