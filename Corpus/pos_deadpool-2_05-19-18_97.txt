Kinda like everything you would expect from a Deadpool sequel including the fact that its an improvement on all fronts The narrative feels fresh involving and far more thick compared to its predecessor  nevermind the fact that the humor snaps at lightning speed acing the timing and making sure a gag doesnt run on for too long The films sense of humor is still extremely hit or miss almost to the point of a bad jokes ability to ruin
