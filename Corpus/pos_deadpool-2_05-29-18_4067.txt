I loved this movie The first in my opinion is still better butthis one had a major addition to the cast Josh Brolin as cable is absolutely brilliant He was great and so was Colossus Â I do however think that some of the comedy didnt fully land Also some off the CGI wasnt polished enough But in all great movie
