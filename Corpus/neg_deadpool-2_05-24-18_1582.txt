It was fine  A lot of jokes fell flat to me but I expected that and the plot was a little weak but  Â Zazie beetz as domino really made this movie for me she just stole every scene she was in and I hope we get more from her Also loved seeing julian dennison in another role since hunt for the wilder people he did a fantastic job was even funnier than Ryan most of the time
