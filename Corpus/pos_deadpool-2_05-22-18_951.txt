Saw it on Friday but forgot to write anything but I think this movie was pretty great  Bigger funnier and better than the first  The movie Took Deadpool as a character  in an interesting direction that I was not expecting  I recommend it if u liked the first  Who am I kidding most of u probably already saw this if u wanted to
