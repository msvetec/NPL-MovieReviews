I wonder if David Leitch and Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir had final cut of this film Particularly the action scenes A lot of the action started out in beautiful wide master shots that would abruptly cut to one of the secondary cameras Many of which were a little too close to the action And the timing was nothing like what I have seen from Leitch previously Im not trying to start some conspiracy its just that this is the first time Ive had to say their action scenes were merely good and not spectacular
