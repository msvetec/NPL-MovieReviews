I actually really liked this It was more violent gory and more outrageous It was more emotional than the first and felt more serious too But obviously it was still as funny and silly as it should be Ryan Reynolds is justurgh yum yum Him and josh brolin really put in the time and effort to get buff And talking of josh brolin he was great So tough and hes an incredible actorÂ  Need to see it again soon
