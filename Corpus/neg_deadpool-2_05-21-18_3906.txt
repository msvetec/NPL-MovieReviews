DEADPOOL 2 David Leitch 2018 _______________ Story Even the biggest fanboys have to admit The plot isnt very good The film feels like they just tucked some funny scenes together not aiming for a coherent story But thats just one of this films problems My biggest issue is that this film thinks its so much smarter than it actually is Still Domino was amazing the XForce was cool a few gags really made me laugh But they throw all that
