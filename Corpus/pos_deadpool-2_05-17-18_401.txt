With the massive success of Deadpool Fox evidently decided to let these guys do whatever the fuck they wanted in this movie and I ate it all up I cant imagine how much more I wouldve loved these movies when I was 13 because that really was the age where Deadpool as a character really clicked for me but I still love them now as an adult dude Just not in a lame way Im super cool and Im not a nerd
