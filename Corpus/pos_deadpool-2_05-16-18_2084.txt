Loved the first one and thought this was on a definite par even though some of the special effects are a little ropey The movies generally well paced with lots of film references here and there jokes a plenty although the odd one falls flat  Friends have said that there have been a number of edits and reshoots for the final theatrical release including more scenes with Cable and Domino which I think was for the better as the dynamics with these characters really brings something more to the film   4 out of 5 Deadpools riding a unicorn from me
