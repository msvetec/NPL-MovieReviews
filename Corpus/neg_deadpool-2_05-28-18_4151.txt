As my favourite superhero I am always going to be a bit biased towards Deadpool However this was by no stretch of the imagination as good as the first film The action sequences were cool and there was a bit more of a narrative but for me personally there werent enough fourth wall breaks Domino was kick ass though And it was nice to see a film finally introduce a certrain character in the way he was meant to be portrayed
