Too long and too boring and for a superhero whose adverting claims he breaks all the rules he didnt stray far from any of the superhero rules that came before None of the other character got any kind of development so I didnt care about them I get it that was part of the joke it just wasnt funny I loved the first Deadpool this was just a shallow copy Again I think that was part of the joke and again it just wasnt funny
