Horrible film Not remotely funny or clever This movie will be for you if you think recognizing things is funny Deadpool 2 relies even more on references than the first one The MCU inparticular Â gets a lot of shoutouts in this one The real killer here though is the attempts at emotion Its tactics are manipulative but is so inept that it doesnt even work on that level It just flat out doesnt resonate which makes its final 10 minutes
