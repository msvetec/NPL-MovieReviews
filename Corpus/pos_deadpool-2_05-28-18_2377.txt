On second viewing the tone issues I had before werent as heavy and the comedy as well as the story itself just clicked with me a lot more Sure it could have been edited better especially those action scenes and the ending felt a bit safe but with what I got here as well as what we have in store this feels like a definitive improvement over the original Deadpool film
