Deadpool 2 is as hilarious as the first one but its better because the story has more heart Cable played by Josh Brolin was amazing and i want to see more of his character in future moviesThe movie was awesomely unexpecting so do not get it spoiled The kid in the movie was hit or miss for me For the most part his acting is pretty good but sometimes its a little cringy Deadpool having protect him for a portion of the movie was kinda clique but thats just a small nit pick This movie is great and is so much fun Definitely a worth sequel
