I was pretty worried about a half hour in Lots of cringy jokes not landing But things pick up when the teams formed and the movie starts making you laugh not simply asking you to laugh I like heroes and villains with powers a storyteller can get really creative with like Dominos and they did a great job showing off her lucky streak Theres one great cameo Vanisher and one totally wasted one the big fella downstairs at the mutant jail More heart than the first flick lamer jokes though
