The jokes I liked I loved but the jokes I disliked I absolutely hated and thats the big problem I had with the movie  It had a lot to like the action was fantastic Domino was great but everything I disliked I really disliked Youre so dark you must be from the DC universe Ughfuck off So ultimately Im not sure where I stand on this but I will say the more I think about the movie the more I only remember what I hated Still giving it three stars for the action and for Domino
