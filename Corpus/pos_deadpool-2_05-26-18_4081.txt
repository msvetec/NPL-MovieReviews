If you liked Deadpool the sequel is more of the same but in a superherofilled marketplace a little more meta humor about the genre isnt unwelcome There is some heart in the plot just enough that it doesnt get muscled out too badly by the aggressive humor The action set pieces are enjoyable enough what is it with the 2010s and ontheroad fights the nerdsavvy quotient is high and the postcredit sequences such as they are provide a real highlight
