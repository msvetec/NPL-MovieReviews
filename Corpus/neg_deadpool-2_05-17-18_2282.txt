This movie reminded me of family guy in that it has this selfaware smugness A lot of the jokes are forced where they just keep repeating the joke at you almost threatening the audience to laugh Theres also a lot of crude humor like when Deadpool calls colossus a cock ring and the teens in the audience giggle
