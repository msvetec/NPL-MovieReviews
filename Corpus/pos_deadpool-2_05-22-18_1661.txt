Let me first say this I will have to view the film a second time There were several scenes were I could literally not stop laughing and pay attention With that said the film was brilliant from beginning to end Ryan Reynolds delivering another hilarious performance in my opinion topping the first film Even if you are not a Marvel fan or comic book fan I feel that you would still enjoy the film Do yourself a favor and go see this movie
