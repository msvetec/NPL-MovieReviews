 Arguably better than the first  Domino is amazing and I actually love her ability  The reveal of a new character about halfway in was pretty epic and a perfect Deadpooltype introduction  I wish the initial XForce sequence had lasted a bit longer in a certain way but dont want to spoil but it was still hysterical  Love the relationships between the characters in this movie and how they played out Especially Deadpool and Cable
