Deadpool 2 is um yeah this is a difficult film to review To start with the positives the action scenes and setpieces were largely very impressive I thought the creativity was at times amazing The cast were likeable clearly Ryan Reynolds was born for Deadpool and for the most part the film was funny However thats where the positives end I would say the pacing is pretty bad  at least five scenes were extended far too far  and
