This had way better directing than the first one but the screenplay was considerably worse Most of the humor lands but then again some of it doesnt which is a problem I didnt have with the first Deadpool Cable was good but underutilized and the rest of the ensemble was overall pretty good Perhaps it wasnt the best idea to let Ryan Reynolds be involved in the writing although he does seem to be having a lot of fun here
