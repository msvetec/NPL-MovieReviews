Forgot to review this one from a week or so ago but what a fun sequel this was Very much more of the same in terms of the humor but still felt fresh and I might have even enjoyed the plot of this one more than the first The cast of characters was great and having a more emotionally vulnerable Deadpool was a nice touch
