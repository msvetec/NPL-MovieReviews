I absolutely loved the first Deadpool which makes it even more satisfying to say that 2 is even better The stupid but funny jokes the usual cast from the first with a decent amount of additions and they even had my jaw drop in the first 25 minutes because of a shocking event that I wouldnt have thought they would dare try If you liked Deadpool then this is a must for your watch list
