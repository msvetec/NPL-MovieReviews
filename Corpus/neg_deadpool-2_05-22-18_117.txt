Enough laughs to make it worth watching with wellorchestrated action sequences but its difficult for this to be anything more than a residual retread of the original film  Blend of satire with hyperstylized violence works for first act but eventually grows a little onedimensional and tiresome  Dont get me wrong I had fun but its not something I would be in a rush to see again
