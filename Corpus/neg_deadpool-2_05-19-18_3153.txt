Pretty disappointed with this one tbh I absolutely adored the first one being my ideal sense of humour and this one was too but similar to Thor 3 many of the jokes fell extremely flat to me and because of much of the improvisation there were a lot of jokes and references they missed due simply too not thinking about in the moment
