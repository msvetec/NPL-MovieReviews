Not the sequel I had hoped for but quite exactly the sequel I thought it would be Unfortunately it does not work to do exactly the same thing twice It does not feel as groundbreaking as the first time which the comic elements are suffering from and the story really sucks Most of the characters work very well and especially Josh Brolin as Cable and the parachute scene is absolutely amazing I am not satisfied at least we always have the original
