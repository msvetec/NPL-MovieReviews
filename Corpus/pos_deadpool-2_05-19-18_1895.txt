Deadpool is definitely more charismatic than he was in the first I found him to be far funnier as well There were so many jokes based around superhero movies that were just hilarious most of the time I really enjoyed Cable because hes just a parody on dark past superheroes Hes so bland and artificial that its just funny The music is also implemented well Theres a scene involving the song Take on Me by aha which was just hilarious
