I really enjoyed Deadpool when it arrived back in 2016 It was a fresh take on the superhero genre and it won me over with its violence and raunchy humor Deadpool 2 on the other hand is still a lot of fun but I also feel like some of the novelty is starting to wear off That Ive had my fair share of this character already There are only so many times you can solely rely your humor on fourthwall
