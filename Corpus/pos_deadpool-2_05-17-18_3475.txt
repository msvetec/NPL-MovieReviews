I think I kind of loved it Tonally and stylistically different from the first theres also a lot more to it It was just a Lot While I miss the Beat Itesque score from the first Id say this one is definitely better Ryan Reynolds is still a gift and so is basically every other person in this film Also it was just really fuckin funny
