This is the best movie released under the Marvel umbrella this year I feel like this Black Panther and Infinity War were all released on the same day and I think AntMan 2 comes out tomorrow will we ever get a break But that being said this is the most coherently told plot out of all three Whereas Infinity Wars second half built to a tall emotional experience youre lying if you cant admit it was all over the place
