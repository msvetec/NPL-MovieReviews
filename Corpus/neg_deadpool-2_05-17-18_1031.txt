I need to give it some time and see it again but seriously who wrote this story Its such a mess Theres way too much going on and none of it is handled with grace which is kind of odd considering we just had a movie with 50 some odd characters all jumbled together in INFINITY WAR that actually worked Everyone in INFINITY WAR has a purpose and the Russos had WAY more character arcs and plot lines to juggle
