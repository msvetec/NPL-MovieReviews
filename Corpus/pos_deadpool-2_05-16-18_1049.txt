Not great but very entertaining a lot of the jokes work like gangbusters and a bunch of them also dont but they hit more results will obviously vary depending on your toleration for this type of humor than they miss though Ryan Reynolds is still great as WadeDeadpool he really was born to play this role This also unlike the first Deadpool feels cinematic and like it was actually DIRECTED David Leitch does a much better job with the action
