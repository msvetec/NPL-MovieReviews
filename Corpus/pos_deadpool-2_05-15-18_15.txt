Ryan Reynolds returns as everyones favourite shittalking mercenary I took a fairly big liking to the first Deadpool film it was a breath of fresh air amongst a wave of increasingly serious comicbook flicks so I was anticipating this one quite a bit Even if Deadpool 2 doesnt exactly advance a whole lot over its predecessor its still a fun time at the movies
