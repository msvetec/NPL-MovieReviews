I had the same problem with this as I did with the first one just because youre selfaware and mocking your bad writing doesnt make the writing notbad and the selfawareness certainly doesnt make up for it That leads to lots of jokes and quips not landing but luckily the movie has such a wide arsenal of bits that loads of them do also hit also the humor was surprisingly less guyish comparing to the first one
