A lot of fun and I think it surpasses the original in terms of humor action and especially rapport among the main characters The film has a schizophrenic attitudes towards superheroics it combines irreverence with a heavy emphasis on incoherent moralizing and the arc of heroic characters learning to use their powers for good and this weighs the film down unfotunately especially with the long drawnout ending I could have done without the girlfriendsdeathissparkofmaleherosjourney thing
