I finally got around to seeing this Deadpool 2 is just as fun as its predecessor For a lot of people the metahumor doesnt cut it Â But I enjoy the hell out of it I think its really clever and super funny at times And obviously every one has been talking about its marvelous post credits scene It really is great
