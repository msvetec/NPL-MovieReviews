If you werent a huge fan of the first this one has a much better budget and funny side characters plus some actions scenes that actually held tension Still not a huge fan of Renolds but Im glad my friend dragged me to see it A year ago I never wouldve guessed that Id enjoy deadpool 2 more than Infinity war
