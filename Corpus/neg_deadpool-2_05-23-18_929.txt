No better and no worse than its predecessor Deadpool 2 is silly puerile and somewhat obnoxious but thats pretty much on brand for the comic book character Ive seen complaints levelled at the selfreferential selfcongratulatory and relentlessly quippy nature of the character but thats a complaint that couldve been levelled to Jim Carrey for the entirety of the 90s
