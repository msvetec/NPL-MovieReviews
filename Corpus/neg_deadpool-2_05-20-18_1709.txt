Ehhhhhhhh So this made me laugh 3 times Which doesnt sound too bad until you consider that it tried to make me laugh about 350 times Until the third act there was seriously no discernible Â plot Everything was just happening with no purpose or objective for a long time Things got a lot funnier toward the end starting with the X Force bit but thats not saying much considering they werent really funny at all in the beginning
