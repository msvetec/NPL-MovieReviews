I thoroughly enjoyed Deadpool 2 I thought there was jokes that didnt quite land as well as they probably hoped however there was jokes that had me howling in laughter I thought the pacing was done well and the mixture of off the walls zaniness and compelling story telling However I could see why some people didnt enjoy the film Similar to certain versions of the comics Deadpool had a lot of meta jokes which I love but I know
