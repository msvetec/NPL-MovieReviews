Did not like the first film down to the Deadpool character himself and away from him nothing memorable to hold on to but the sequel away from the man himself has things going for it it looks better far more engaging action and entertaining support characters and Villains due to this i even tolerated Deadpool a little more he still could dial it back a bit but i really didnt hate him this time around really wasnt expecting much and i really was the arms folded guy going into this so a nice suprise here
