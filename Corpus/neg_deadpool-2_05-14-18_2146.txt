it wasnt as good as the first i give it a 6510 uneven pacing poor CG the fight choreography was good more John WIcky than Deadpooly Cable is meh Domino is great there are a handful of laugh out loud parts where youll miss the next joke but not enough the subversion does get to a point where it derails the film It does seem like there were a few plot threads that were lost in the editing in effort
