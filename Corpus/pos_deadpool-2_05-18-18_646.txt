Dont get me wrong  Deadpool 2 is a damn good time at the movies It just isnt as refreshingly wonderful as the original film which I think took us all genuinely by surprise This sequel is full of laugh out loud moments and even a few genuinely emotional ones but there are long stretches where it feels a bit like its treading water Forever kudos though to Ryan Reynolds and Co for not holding ANYTHING back when it comes
