Im a big fan of the first DEADPOOL take that for what its worth I guess but Id argue that DEADPOOL 2 is more clever and has a better overall focus That said though if you hated the first film Id advise that you just skip this one Its essentially the same thing  same style same structure same rhythms same meta approach  just different jokes and plot points
