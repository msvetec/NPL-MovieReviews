Best comic book film of 2018 That said I missed the simplicity of the first film the world definitely doesnt need another blow everything up superhero movie And as a Kiwi Julian Dennison took me out of the film But it made me laugh and I was entertained throughout which is more than I can say for the other two wellreceived comic book movies released this year
