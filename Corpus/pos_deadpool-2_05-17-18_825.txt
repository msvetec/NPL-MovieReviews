Probably one of the best sequels ever made Yes Im going that far because I enjoyed the fuck out of this one probably even more than I did the first one tbh Its got the overthetop violence the profanity the humor the constant references the fourth wall breaks etc and man did those end credits scenes satisfy along with the small cameos throughout the movie Ryan Reynolds owns this role of course along with newcomers Cable and Domino who were great as well
