94 The old gang returns some new ones are introduced things get incredibly dark yet at the same time we get plenty of the same juvenile humor and meta injokes Its a crazy mesh of tones but most of the time it works For me sincere elements like the heaven scenes are hard to take because weve been programmed to expect something stupid to happen The amazing rise and fall of XForce is a highlight
