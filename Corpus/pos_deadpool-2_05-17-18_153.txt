I cant tell you how excited I was to watch this movie This was my third or forth most anticipated movie of the year and I absolutely loved it Going in I was afraid that it would be a recycle of the first one but boy I was so wrong Here is what I said in my review of Deadpool a few days ago Many things like the villain or the simple revenge and origin story work for this movie
