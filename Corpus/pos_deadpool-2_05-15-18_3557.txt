this movie is hilarious not all of the jokes land on the spot but most of them did and it was such a fun thrill to watch this movie i love how they the creative team behind the film continue to not take themselves serious and are making fun of so much things from other movies cinematic universes comic books references and basically pop culture i had a blast i believe they are trying to forward the story for potential sequences and etc and im in for this
