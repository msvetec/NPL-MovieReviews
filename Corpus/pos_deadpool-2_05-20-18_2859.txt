If you liked Deadpool 1 Deadpool 2 is more of the same with a comparable level of quality humor and action I personally liked it a bit better as it had more Marvel characters showing up and a more touching emotional core as Deadpool tries to outLogan Logan Now I dont care about Cable never have but he makes a pretty good Terminatortype for the purposes of this movie out to kill that kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople Julian
