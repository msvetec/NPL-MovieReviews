I loved the first one and thought the last trailer looked great but I didnt really have big expectations for this mostly because Ive been so distracted by other films so far this year Anyways I thought it was really solid Humor isnt as consistent as the first one IMO but when the jokes land theyre hilarious There are a some moments throughout that are definitely funnier than the first movie which I feel like is all you can really
