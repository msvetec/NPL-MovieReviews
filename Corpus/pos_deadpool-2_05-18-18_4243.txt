It was a fun movie to watch I feel like the surprise villain made it really interesting I didnt really like the first act so much with them going to jail and all that It was pretty dull and could use a little bit more uniqueness to it I also noticed how these movies have a weird filter to them and I feel because its Deadpool and its supposed to be highenergy fun that the movie should be more colorful
