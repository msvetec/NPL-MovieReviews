Deadpool 2 was really good and super funny but sometimes I felt like the scenes were just drawn out too long just my own personal opinion I loved Josh Brolin as Cable perfect fit IMO and Zazie Beetz as Domino Those two were perfectly casted Ryan Reynolds was born for this role too Nothing short of maximum effort from the Merk with a Mouth
