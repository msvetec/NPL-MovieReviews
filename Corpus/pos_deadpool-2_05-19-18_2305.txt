I was pleasantly surprised by the first Deadpool and the sequel surpasses that one although somewhat modestly It really leans in on the humor edging this almost to a parody movie The action scenes are stronger here as well probably owing to the bigger budget These movies are not high art by any means but as a nice diversion on a summer day you can do so much worse
