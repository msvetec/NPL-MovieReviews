I enjoyed this WAY more than the first film The humor works better because the story is bettermore engaging the action is so much cleaner and it doesnt look nearly as ugly Cable and Domino are great additions to the crew and Im happy Julian Dennison gets to do a lot Surprisingly sincere andprogressive Bring on XForce
