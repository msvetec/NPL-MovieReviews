Deadpool 2 gave me pretty much everything I wanted from it Outrageous moments fourth wall breaking pop culture and comic book references aplenty and lots more action than the original The action is actually much improved this time due to a much bigger budget and John Wick director David Letich coming on board I can say I definitely enjoyed this more than the first movie which I like a lot but dont love and I hope there is a 3rd entry because I feel like Ryan Reynolds and Co have really just hit their strideÂ  PS The post credits scenes are fantastic Definitely stick around
