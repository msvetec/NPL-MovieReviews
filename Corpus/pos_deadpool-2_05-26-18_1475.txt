The merc with a mouth wasnt particularly funny in his first outing so its fitting that Deadpool 2 only comes into its own when the supporting cast fleshes out in the second act  Zazie Beetzs Domino and Josh Brolins Cable are the standouts Its the violent slapstick and crudity that generate the most laughs however the film gets quite a few laughs out of Deadpools fragilityimmortality while Tyler Batess final fight music blends standard epic tones with vulgarity to hilarious effect Leitch directs the comedy decently and the action terrifically
