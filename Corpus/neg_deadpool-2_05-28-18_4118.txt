Really tough to judge this movie Unlike the vast majority of superhero movies it doesnt really rely on well known comic book characters fighting it out Instead comedy is its strongest feature The clever outrageous and self aware humor for me really teeters between enjoyable and irritating I think the audience can help it work unfortunately I saw it in an unenthusiastic crowd
