Letter Grade B Screenplay A bit dull at times especially in the first half Also not as wittyfunny as the first one Story Decent didnt really keep my interest Cinematography Fine I guess Sound Holy shitballs Nuff said Editing Some fun stuff in there especially during the XForce landing sequence Title sequence was amusing as well Characters I actually really liked Cable And of course Deadpool himself is still great Acting Decent
