Its a lot of fun very enjoyable Same irreverent tone as the first one and keeps that tone in check here  its important that they didnt try to top the breaking of the fourth wall any more than they did in the first film otherwise the whole thing could spin out of control rather quicklyÂ  Was surprised how much I ended up liking Cable Brolin did a nice job with the role having a limited amount of screen time
