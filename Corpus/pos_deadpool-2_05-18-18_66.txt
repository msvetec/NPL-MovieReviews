By ditching its need to try and be a conventional superhero flick this one actually feels like a better movie Reynolds and Brolin have fantastic chemistry and Zazie Beetzs Domino completely steals the show I honestly cant wait to see where Brolins Cable goes from here Leitchs direction suits this film much better than Tim Millers and Wades character finally has some stakes The injokes and cameos are funnier the action looks cleaner and it finally feels like a XMen
