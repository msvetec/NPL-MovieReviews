This movie is better than the first in every single way imaginable We have great acting all across the board great action scenes and cinematography from a few of the guys who did John Wick a soundtrack that rivals the original and most importantly a script that is more serious and tragic than you think it is going be but still has time to be incredibly hilarious The jokes are even more meta than they were in the first film
