When there are so many jokes even a 5050 ratio of hits to misses will bet you a good number of laughs and thats the case here The supporting cast is good here and Brolin nails it as the straight guy in the back half There was a little bit too much XMen crossover stuff for my liking but the first deployment of the XForce crew more than made up for it
