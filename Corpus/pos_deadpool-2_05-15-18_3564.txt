I liked this film I liked it a lot butttttt Just because there are jokes about lazy writing does not make lazy writing okay there is a lot of it throughout this film Though who goes to a superhero film for the writing Good action Mostly good jokes 5 star worthy end credit scenes Its enjoyable and im perfectly satisfied with this film Some scenes did drag a fair amount though But it was fun and they did some pretty cool stuff with it
