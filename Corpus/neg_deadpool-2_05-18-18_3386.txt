Im reeeeaally trying not to second guess myself or go back on any thoughts or opinions because I enjoyed this probably as much as I could a Deadpool movie The fourthwall breaking jokes as they call them are annoying from the very start and dont get better But on the other hand the action supporting cast and other comedic moments are much stronger than its predecessor which I dont like You cant tell its helmed by someone who knows how
