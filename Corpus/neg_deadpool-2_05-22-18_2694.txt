Im so glad Domino finally showed up in a movie Shes a longtime favorite Otherwise well as with the first Im not a huge fan but its good messy fun I enjoyed it The action was very welldone some of the humor was really strong and some made me groan and the message of nonviolence was just plain dumb under the circumstances An enjoyable theatrical experience and Id recommend it but I doubt Ill be revisiting this again like the first
