Deadpool 2 is a solid sequel Its not really better or worse than the original As it features both the originals strengths and weaknesses It has the same action laughs and fun of its predecessor But its also has some generic scenes and a few jokes that dont land But as a whole its a very funny and enjoyable sequel If you like the first youll definitely love this If you dont care for the first it probably wont do you any favors
