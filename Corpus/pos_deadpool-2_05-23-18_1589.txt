I can only compare this to the first movie which was the freshest action flick since Crank and Shoot Em Up This is just more of the same but somehow more refined The story just worked better was more FUN and side characters were awesome If you liked the first one youll like this probably even more If you thought the first one was meh you might actually like this Others shouldnt bother Simple
