More of the same but noticeably worse than its predecessor Some of that comes from the fact that its not as novel its not the first big Rrated superhero flick anymore Some of it comes from the script not balancing the humor with everything else as well as the first film did Some of it comes from bad CGII mean theres whole sequences that actually look really really bad Theres some hillarious moments and its a fun watch but its more of the same If you like it you like it but theres far less to like in this one than the last
