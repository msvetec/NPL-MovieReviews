Deadpool 2 is a sequel to Deadpool and fans of the first film will probably like this film as well It has the same joking tone to it with jokes littered throughout the runtime of this film This sequel however tries to set up a more serious tone by making Deadpool a more sympathetic character rather than his joking and badmouthed self that doesnt want to team up with anyone and likes to roam on his own
