I admit that I enjoy movies that doesnt take themselves too seriously One could say that Deadpool 2 lacks substance and Im quite certain the creators used that as a gimmick My question is if this overthetop silly and bloody humor and Deadpools big mouth are gonna get me tired eventually Cause some the crazy antics in Deadpool 2 fell flat to me But I still had a good solid time watching it
