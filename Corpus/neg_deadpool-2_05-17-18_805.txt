Deadpool 2 has more enjoyable and funny moments than the original but I still found it just as tiring a watch Its so determined to prove how clever it is and this leads to it being painful to watch at points I liked the addition of Josh Brolin Julian Dennison and Zazie Beetz but there were just too many moments where instead of laughing I ended up groaning at how hard the film was trying A lot of people will absolutely love Deadpool 2 but it just wasnt for me
