Absolutely hysterical So much funnier and less on the nose than the first one this coming from someone who absolutely loved the first one The romantic aspect of the first one was an added benefit but 2 did a great job of minimal romance screen time with a long lasting emotional impact I cried twice in an R rated sequel of a super hero movie The characters are all super adorable but x force couldve displayed their powers more rather than combat action scenes Completely enjoyable throughout and very well done not to mention the action was really fun smooth and well choreographed
