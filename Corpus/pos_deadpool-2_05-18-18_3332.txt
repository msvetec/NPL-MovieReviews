Before the film started I saw the trailers for 3 films every single one of them had a woman diebe harmed to progress the male protagonists storyline and while this film was funny and witty it still perpetuated that same trope that i am so tired of i probably wouldnt have noticed if i hadnt seen those other trailers though also less tj miller and rape jokes and more negasonic teenage warhead please
