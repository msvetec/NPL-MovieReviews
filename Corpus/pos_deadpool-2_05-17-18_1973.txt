Tons of fun I think I may like it more than the original It goes for a smaller scale this time around focusing more on character and creating a story about family much like the first film was actually a love story disguised as a superhero movie All the new characters are fantastic but a little underutilized Cable being on screen is my childhood dream come true and Josh Brolin does him justice If you liked what the first film had to offer youll have plenty to chew on with this one Stay for the mid credits scene Its one of the best ones ever made
