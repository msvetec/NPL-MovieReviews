Pretty much equal to the first The action is way better thanks to Leitchs slick direction but the movie takes itself a little too seriously this time around and the jokes dont always land I didnt buy the relationship between Ryan Reynolds and Julian Dennison However this is Josh Brolins fucking year The guy is a badass as Cable and fits right into this universe
