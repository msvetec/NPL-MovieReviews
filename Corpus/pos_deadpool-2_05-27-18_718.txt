I thought the first Deadpool was fine but this one is an improvement on almost every level Its hilarious and super entertaining Deadpool is great as always Cable is fine and Domino is my favorite addition and one of the best parts of the movie My favorite scene has to be the parachuting sequence followed by that great chase
