Consistently chuckleinducing but lacks the narrative focus of the first one and it tries very hard for you to create an emotional bond with the protagonist which really didnt work for me When its selfaware and silly its fun the way they used the XForce team is genius when it tries more than that its awkward Zazie Beetz is great of course
