Deadpool 2 is a great film It was funny violent and had a really fun story that wasnt as predictable as I thought it wouldve been The characters were all really cool and funny and I loved every single one of them I did feel that the film felt a little bit longer than the run time itself but I think I felt it because Im pretty tired today Also the end credits scence was amazing but dont stay till
