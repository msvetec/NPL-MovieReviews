MUCH better than the first Deadpool Im loving where super hero films are heading because its not dealing with so much love story We get to see heros deal with family issues and being a person in a hero role Yes we still see some love story but it wasnt overwhelming Personally felt there were too many child molestation jokes I understand its Deadpool and these are his type of jokes but it was too much at times
