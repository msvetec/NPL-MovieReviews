Deadpool 2 is the sequel to 2016s Deadpool and even though I wasnt a huge fan of the first film the sequel managed to bring me back on board with the beloved antihero Overall this is a great movie the cinematography was strong and the effects were on point most of the time Even though I prefer films where the score is the main background music at all times the soundtrack was awesome and a fitting choice for the film
