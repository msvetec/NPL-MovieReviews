Though I found it to be uneven predictable and problematically clichéd I can honestly say I enjoyed Deadpool 2 more than the first one While Deadpools meta humor tended to stick  to skewering the XMen franchise and studio politics the very specific comic book references in the sequel got some genuinely massive laughs out of me As someone who used to hunt down 80s and 90s XMenXForce books at comic stores and flea markets as a kid I realize that there is some bias in giving any star rating for this movie But hey it is what it is
