I didnt love the first Deadpool but I did think it was a fun little diversion which stood out when compared to the state of superhero films in the 2010s I had an open mind in the sequel too especially given a bigger budget and the prior success to dive deeper into the comic book storylines And to their credit the filmmakers did Deadpool 2 is way more competent as an action movie than the first film in no small
