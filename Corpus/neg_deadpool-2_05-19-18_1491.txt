I somewhat enjoyed this Ryan Reynolds is very annoying as this character but they addressed it several times and he had some decent lines It has a pretty even ratio of bits and duds The X Force stuff was gold The storyline was derivative of better movies but oh well it was fun Folks this Â has a reference to the movie THE PROPOSITION in it And some fun cameos I loved Domino Its funny that the last movie I watched before this happened to be LOOPER because this movie borrows from it heavily
