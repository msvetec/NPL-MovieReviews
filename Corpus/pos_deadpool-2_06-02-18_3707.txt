Theres this joke in Deadpool 2 where newcomer Domino played with fun zest by Zazie Beetz sees Deadpools horribly scarred face for the first time She recoils in disgust and TJ Millers character jokingly and knowingly repeats his Deadpool joke as he trails off He looks like an avocado had sex with an older Its funny like Deadpool is referencial and crude But Deadpool 2 echoes this joke in terms that it works it is funny but it robs itself
