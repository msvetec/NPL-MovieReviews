Still has issues as a superhero movie and the dramatic elements though Im glad theyre there feel a bit overcooked The first half had jokes that were all as good as the top half of Deadpool but when the final act comes around the humor slowly erodes away and tries to bite its way back into the movie sort of detracting from the action or drama But can I complain about that in a Deadpool movie
