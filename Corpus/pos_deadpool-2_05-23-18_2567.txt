The Empire Strikes Back The Godfather part 2 and Deadpool 2  3 sequels that have far surpassed the original As an admitted Comic Book movie detractor I will admit I went into this film feeling a bit tepid I mean I liked Deadpool a lot actually but I didnt write home about it Deadpool 2 however has raised the bar Even if youve never seen a comic book film or even seen The first Deadpool you will enjoy this
