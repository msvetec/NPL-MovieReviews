Had higher highs than the first but overall the pacing isnt as consistent That pacing is mostly due to the movie suffering a bit of squelitis Deadpool 1 was a super simple premise while this tackles a more complex plot with a larger character roster Still a great time tho The jokes really land more often than not and the action scenes are super fun I also bumped the score up half a star solely due to the amazing midcredits scene
