For a while I never bothered with the MCU or any comic book movies in general The only comic book films I enjoyed were THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy But then I saw the first DEADPOOL  I changed my mind about comic book films accepting the fact that they dont have to be realistic or dramatic to be considered great or to watch It made me realize I need some fun when I watch a film once in a while Naturally
