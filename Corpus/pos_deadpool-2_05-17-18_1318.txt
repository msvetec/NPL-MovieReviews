While Deadpool 2 improves on everything that made the original movie a lot of fun it comes with its own baggage and story issues while this isnt all bad it does drag down the structure However the emotional aspect was good and worked throughout the movie well the action is all here the humor is mostly excellent and the mid credits scenes are perfect Overall an improvement but could still use some work from a plotting perspective
