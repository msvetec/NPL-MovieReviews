Tomb Raider is a fun time Its a generic Indiana Jones like adventure thats not afraid to push the limits of its PG13 rating People die in it Alicia Vikander is good as Tomb Raider and there are some really enjoyable action scenes However its a really bad script and there were many places that could have been way better with just a few rewrites The actual tomb raiding is very disappointing I was expecting much more of it Theres
