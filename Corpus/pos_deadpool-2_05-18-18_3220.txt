Far out by far my favorite Deadpool character is Deadpool himself The sequel is superior to the first film because I found the firsts humor to be intolerably slapstick and forced The jokes just hit the right notes this time Didnt like Juggernaut His head is way too small for his body and character design could be more interesting
