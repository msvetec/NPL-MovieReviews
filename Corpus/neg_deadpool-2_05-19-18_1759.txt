I dont know guys I just wasnt a fan of Deadpool 2 While I was disappointed at the absence of Tim Miller I was excited at how they got David Leitch known for his work in films like John Wick and Atomic Blonde At the very least I believed if the story was so so the fight scenes would at least be very intense and well shot
