I was worried that after what I felt was a perfect imagining of Deadpool the first time around the sequel would have felt flat Nope Just as infantile as before Deadpool is back with a ton of manpain and a new enemy The audience was cackling at points and the postcredits scene finished us off My only criticism would be the slow motion ballad scenes wore things after a while but Zazie Beetz gave us our first female superhero with armpit hair so fuck it Deadpool 2 can do whatever it wants
