What a fun time this movie was It is right on par with the first one and even includes more pop culture references which I appreciated including a Saw VII reference Human Centipede reference and even a Passion of the Christ box office reference The first two  thirds of the film are especially awesome but then the final act loses its steam a little and begins to unravel I also would have liked to see more of Juggernaut The
