Funnier faster and more action packed than the first film Reynolds is at his best as Deadpool and is joined by Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz as Cable and Domino respectively who are both incredibly fun and badass additions to the films roster While the beginning starts off a little aimless and sluggish D2 kicks into high octane around the 2nd act and doesnt take its foot off the pedal Deadpool 2 is just pure joy
