This movie is just swell Ryan Reynolds is an absolute genius and his utter commitment to this role really does show The one thing I will say about this movie is that the first act feels a little out of place with the rest of the movie and is kinda slow but as soon as the second act kicks in its one hell of a ride  XForce additions like Domino and cable are fantastic and get me excited about the future of this franchise I dont really know what else to say this movie is great please go watch it you wont be disappointed
