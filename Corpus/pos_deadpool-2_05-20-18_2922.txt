i thought the first one was okay just a fun entertaining time when everyone hyped it up as one of the best superhero movies i got more cynical about it however i thought this was incredible the story actually had substance the humor was very selfaware and most jokes were funny the main thing i liked about it was that there were actually interesting wellwritten characters that we could actually invest in unlike the first one which was just deadpool
