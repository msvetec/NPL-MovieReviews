Xforce  Mostly more of the same but with an upped X factor The comedy was stronger the plot was thicker and the action was more intense Theres no way around the fact however that if you didnt like the first you wont like the sequel While I felt the first was a bit light on story and had a lot of flat jokes Deadpool 2Â was everything I wanted from the first film It feels looks and reads more like the comic counterpart in basically every way I thoroughly enjoyed it
