I saw this it didnt really register apart from the passing of time the photons hitting my eyes and the sound waves hitting ears but it raises a point about humour jokes that are referential specifically The joke works if you get the reference thats a different kind of humour from the observational or slapstick which dont require a specific piece of information coming from human nature I have a weird feeling about referential jokes that they tickle the tummy
