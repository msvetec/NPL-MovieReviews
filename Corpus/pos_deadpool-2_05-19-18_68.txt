Unfortunately I wasnt invested in the story or the emotional beats as much as I was with the first one I do appreciate its earnest attempts to be sincere and have a purpose it just didnt hit home for me Brolin as Cable was great but the character was just there for the plot and didnt really get a sense of who he was I also really wasnt on board with Firefist
