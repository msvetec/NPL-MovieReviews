I think I prefer this sequel all the performances were great especially Josh Brolin and Zazzie Beats Not all of the jokes landed for me some of the humour felt too easy But then there were a lot of surprises that really made me laugh This story and approach is what I wanted to see from Deadpool I dont like a reliance on the meta humour I like a focus on the sadder darker side of the funny character When they make a third I hope they bring in a literal embodiment of Death a beautiful skeleton lady maybe played by Selma Hayek
