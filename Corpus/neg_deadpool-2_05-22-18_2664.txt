I think I really hated this film but Im not sure I feel numb resigned after watching this Like I lost something So many pop culture references and so much 80s music and so many dumb fucking injokes Look I dont go to movies for this shit I dont need to feel like Im hanging out with friends Just tell a goddamn story already
