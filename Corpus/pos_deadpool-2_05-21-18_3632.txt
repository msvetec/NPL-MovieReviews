I cant say this was a step forward or backwards for the franchise The cameo towards the beginning is fantastic and right on track with how you would expect Deadpools life to go The movie is a fun ride that both feels similar to the first and very different at the same time The additions of Cable and Domino were not a necessary addition but a worthy addition to Deadpool He can 100 carry a movie by himself but it only makes sense to continue building his character and world Ryan Reynolds was born for this role I cant picture anybody as Deadpool
