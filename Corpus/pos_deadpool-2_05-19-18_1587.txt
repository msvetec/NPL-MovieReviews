While I enjoyed the first Deadpool movie and still like it a lot it had a weak story some of the best jokes were given away in the trailers and sometimes it tried way too hard to be shocking and vulgar Deadpool 2 is less crude more violent more clever and dare I say even better than its predecessor The action is spectacular and Ryan Reynolds knocks it out of the ballpark again He shows off a side of Deadpool
