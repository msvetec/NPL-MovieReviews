Were talking away I dont know what Im to say Ill say it anyway Todays another day to find you Shying away Ill be coming for your love okay Take on me take on me Take me on take on me Ill be gone In a day or two So needless to say Im odds and ends But Ill be stumbling away Slowly learning that life is okay Say after me Its no better to be safe than sorry Take on me take on me Take me on take on me Ill be gone In a day or two
