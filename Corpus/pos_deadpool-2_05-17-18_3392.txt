One of the better marvel movies ever made Funnier and darker than the first which is the fucking amazing Maybe I just dont remember the first that well but I think I enjoyed this one more Best endcredit scenes Marvel has produced I just wish Marvel would stop with the god damn plot holes that make no fucking sense
