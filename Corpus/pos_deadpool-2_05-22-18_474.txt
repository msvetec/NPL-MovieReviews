A little less balls out than the first but an even bigger fuck you attitude Really enjoyed the return of Negasonic Teenage Warhead still not enough of her tho and my favorite Tupacloving Kiwi Ricky Baker What really makes this film a win is how obvious it is that Ryan Reynolds is having an insane amount of fun with it
