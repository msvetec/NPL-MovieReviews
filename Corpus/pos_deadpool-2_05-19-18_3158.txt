What the actual fuck I did not expect this That was so much better than I thought I went into this with low expectations since the first part wasnt that big of a thing to me but this is now one of the most entertaining Marvel movies I have ever watched By entertaining I mean funny It was hilarious I literally laughed so much This was so much fun Besides the fun parts it actually included some very serious moments
