Deadpool 2 is fun hilarious even at times but lacks the originality and charm of the original There are a lot of moments that feel like theyre just there because people liked them in Deadpool 1 and while some of the gags were really great a few of them fell flat which isnt something I ever had an issue within the first one Its a fun movie but its by no means a great one
