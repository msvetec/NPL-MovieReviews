Its just reference after reference after reference Most of the jokes are so lazy and with no setup basically just Deadpool referencing some movie preferably within the Marvel universe But judging by the theatre I was in that seems to be enough for most people The plot is a mess and its really a shame about the joke because they manage to do some decent stuff when they actually try When the humour gets physical like in the skydivelanding scene
