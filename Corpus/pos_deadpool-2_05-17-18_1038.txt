I really enjoy the first Deadpool I really enjoy the character both in film and comics and I was looking forward to this I was hoping for a sequel that was a little more surreal than the last one with its fourthwall breaking and we dont get that but its not a total loss It does the number one thing that comedy sequels shouldnt do in that there are a handful of jokes from the first one that they remake
