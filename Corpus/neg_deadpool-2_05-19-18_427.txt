Deadpool 2 was basically what I expected I liked it about the same amount as the first Deadpool movie There were some seriously funny bits but there were also some things that bothered me During the comedic parts the movie was great When it tried being all serious and having an actual plot meh it was kind of weak in that aspect of things
