While not quite as good as the first film Deadpool 2 is a worthy enough sequel with some hilarious moments Ryan Reynolds captures all the wit and charm of pool but the story is a little lacking and disappoints The break out performance comes from Domino who delivers a charismatic carefree performance and really nails the character down Some nice cameo appearances including but not limited to additional XMen characters Matt Damon and Brad Pitt
