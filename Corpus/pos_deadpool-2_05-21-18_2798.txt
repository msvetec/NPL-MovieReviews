Never liked Deadpool in the comics other than in team books and in Wolverine Origins I loved the first movie and in this theyve kept him as part of a team dynamic There are times that the constant jokes threaten to capsize the whole movie but its fine Cable is great and Domino steals every scene shes in Shes amazing I kind of hope this is it theres not much more you can do with the character But the endcreditsstingers are the best youll ever see
