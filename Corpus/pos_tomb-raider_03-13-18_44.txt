What you have heard about Tomb Raider is indeed true this is the best video game movie weve had so far Sure thats not saying much but this is a very fun and enjoyable movie with tons of great fan service for fans of the games like me but not in a distracting way at all The fan service never overshadows the story or characters and that is how fan service should be done Alicia Vikander is great as Lara
