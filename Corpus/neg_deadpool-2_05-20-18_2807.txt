This definitely has its flaws and quite a few of the jokes fall flat on their face but quite honestly I enjoyed it just fine Whether or not its better than the first film Im not too sure Theyre both on the same level to me If I had to pick though it would probably be this one since theres way more fun characters and the action set pieces are executed in a more entertaining wayÂ
