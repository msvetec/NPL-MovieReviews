I cant believe this movie was THAT good The action sequences are amazing and the movie per se is very entretaining What I loved the most is that Lara is an action heroine who allows herself to be vulnerable at times and that is so important because theres some misconception that somehow says female warriors or heroines cant be strongbraveindependent and vulnerable  This movie proves all that wrong  Lara is a strong independent and badass woman who still becomes vulnerable
