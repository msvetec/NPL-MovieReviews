My expectations might have been so low that I actually somewhat enjoyed this pretty much average action adventure flick There were some cool bits here and there and the entire third act did a great job of convincing me that a sequel wouldnt hurt But next time perhaps with focusing more on the stuff that worked delving into the mythological stuff for example and less time spent on boring bullshit like all that melodrama and those forced Trinity teasers or
