Finally a video game film whose only major missteps are the contrived sequel bait ending and Dominic Wests hilariously shitty wig Im honestly surprised how much I enjoyed this film It doesnt do anything groundbreaking but it hits all the essential notes of an action adventure movie and hits them well with all credit to Vikander as an excellent Lara She is as convincing in her moments of vulnerability as she is in her moments of asskicking and as always magnetic to watch on screen Every man in this movie loves her and its not hard to see why
