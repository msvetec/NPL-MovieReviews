Tomb Raider is a surprisingly fun action film that manages to distance itself from its early 2000s counterpart Alicia Vikander certainly is an interesting choice but she definitely was the right choice to play Lara Croft since she was electric the entire film It may have fallen into the typical cliches that action films tend to go toward but Kimiko was a very interesting subject for her to try to find Tomb Raider is an altogether fun film that I definitely want to see again just to see all of the other little details that I missed this time
