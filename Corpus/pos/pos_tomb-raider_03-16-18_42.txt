Im surprised this turned out good Definitely wasnt expecting that It actually kept my attention throughout the whole film Alicia Vikander did a great job as Lara Croft I thought she would do poorly but she made a fool out of me Now all I want to do is revisit some old Tomb Raider video games after watching this movie
