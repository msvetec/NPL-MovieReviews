I enjoyed the original Tomb Raider with Angelina Jolie and was on board with this reboot having Alicia Vikander take on Laura Croft but she clearly is way too talented for this low brow material Someone I know who writes for the Express put it perfectly that this is not a bad movie its not a good movie its just there Though it has exciting moments the stuff in the middle is really muddy with lots of talking to themselves
