This is fun Alicia Vikander is terrific as always and theres some solid emotional groundwork here A lot of the set pieces are done very well especially the rusted plane sequence which is terrific I would have liked a bit more time with Lara alone on the island and the film doesnt always trust its audience to connect the dots flashbacks and voiceover arent always necessary Makes me wish there were more traditional actionadventure films being made
