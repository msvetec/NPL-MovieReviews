This movie is a solid actionadventure that captures Lara Crofts essence unlike the overly sexual and cringey Angelina Jolie performances It has the mystery of Indiana Jones and the fast paced action of the Craig Bond films The set pieces are heavily inspired by the new generation of gritty Tomb Raider games I look forward to the sequels
