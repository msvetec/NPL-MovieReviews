Part of me feels Im being too nice with the 4 stars but I cant really think of a good reason to knock it down There are some small annoying parts for various reasons but overall the film had a nice steady build of the story and you could see a young Lara turn to the badass Lara throughout the film And then you pepper that with some really good scenes and you get a 4 star movie
