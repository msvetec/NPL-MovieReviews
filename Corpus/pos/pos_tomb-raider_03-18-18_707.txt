As time has passed Ive wanted to rewatch Tomb Raider more I really just enjoyed the hell out of this movie Yes of course this movie does have its flaws but I can really look over that and its really just because of the enjoyment I had with this movie It does have a couple cliches and if youve played the new games youll kinda know how the movie will end The movie does feels a lot like the game
