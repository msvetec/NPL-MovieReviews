As a person who hasnt seen the original Tomb Raider films or isnt really a huge fan of video game adaptation movies I gotta admit this wasnt as bad as I was expecting because I really enjoyed this Alicia Vikander was great as Croft and the movie itself is just very entertaining I also feel it didnt take itself too seriously like most video game adaptation movies do And I wasnt going into this expecting a masterpiece so thats probably why I enjoyed it I recommend this and Ill check out the original Tomb Raiders eventually
