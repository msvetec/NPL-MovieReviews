As a blockbuster actionadventure film it waivers between entertaining and uninspired As a video game movie its the Mona Lisa of the genre Vikander gives a compelling and impressive performance displaying both the badassery  vulnerability the new Lara Croft embodies Its refreshing to see a video game adaptation done right especially when the source material is chockfull of Unchartedesque set pieces and heartpounding action sequences to pull from I can safely say that I dont dread the obligation of a sequel and may even admit to looking forward to it
