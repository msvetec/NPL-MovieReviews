I quite enjoyed Tomb Raider It has a number of issues It has a little too much shoeleather throughout it which it annoyingly doubles up by explaining who Lara Croft is in the first hour then what she is trying to dostop in the second hour You could have combined the acts of the film with a little more subtlety and probably lost fifteen minutes However this is a minor complaint because the film is a rather human entertaining actionadventure
