I suppose Angelina Jolie will always be Lara Croft to me She had that iconic look Sadly she didnt have great films to go with it Scriptwise TOMB RAIDER is an improvement Alicia Vikanders Croft is less idealized and more realistic taking the same kind of bumps that Indiana Jones did in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK Having Walton Goggins as the villain is always a good thing as well Not classic but a promising start
