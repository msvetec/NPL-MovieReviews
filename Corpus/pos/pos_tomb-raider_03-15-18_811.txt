Actionadventure packed at its best This was exciting and quite epic Watched it just for Alicia Vikander and it paid of very well She is THE Lara Croft actress I cant think of a better woman to play the role she really nailed it Got huge vibes from the 2013 and 2016 games here They didnt only use some of the story material from the games they also managed to give this movie the original feeling and breathtaking moments that
