This was a perfectly good time at the movies Who doesnt love a jungle adventure with a badass woman protagonist ancient temples boobytrapped tombs and mummy curses I especially loved the Fox Race near the beginning and the gorgeous shot of Vikander when she falls into the ocean in the shipwreck She is gorgeous and moves beautifully on camera as an action star Her trail running scenes were especially inspiring to me But shes a little grim as always No
