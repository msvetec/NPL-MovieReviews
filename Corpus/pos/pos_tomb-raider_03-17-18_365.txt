As a fan of the video game I am pleasantly pleased Enough fan service is done to create a familiar story with some new added elements The action sequences definitely drive the film and Alicia Vikander does a great job as expected Her beauty is undeniable but I just wish the film wasnt so preoccupied with keeping her face so clean the whole time Lara goes through a ton of shit is it really so hard to give her some more scratches and dirt and sweat
