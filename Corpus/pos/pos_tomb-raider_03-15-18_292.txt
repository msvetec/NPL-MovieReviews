Incredibly fun adaptation that adheres to gameplay and the adventure of the long legacy of video games that came before Its loud bombastic and full of exciting action and doesnt get beyond just enough ludicrous scenes but easy to identify if you were among those that played out the ridiculous scenarios Really enjoyed it nostalgia feels with good imagery
