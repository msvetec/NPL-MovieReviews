Some quick thoughtsIt feels like a 90s adventure film it doesnt do anything original  Better than any other Indiana Joneslike film I can think of Better than Temple of Doomnot as high highs but  better overall Nowhere near as good as Raiders or Last Crusade of course It did its job and kept me more or less entertained and didnt outstay its welcome
