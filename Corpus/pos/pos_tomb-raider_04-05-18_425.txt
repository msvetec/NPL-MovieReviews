Alicia Vikander made my wig go missing I love three things in partivular about this movie One is the videogame aesthetic it was just like I was playing I could feel the joystick in my hand Two is that this Lara Croft is a superheroine in a sense but with that side of humanity that reaches you And three is the fact that shes strong and has a halo of seduction without being hyper sexualised To be honest her arms are enough to turn you on you dont need anything more
