Tomb Raider is a good film Alicia Vikander is a great actress and an amazing protagonist of the film The story is thrilling but its pretty predictable and cliche most of the time There are also many unrealistic sequences that happened to Laura Croft so it made some scenes look pretty dumb Setting all the flaws aside it was still a really fun film that ie a great popcorn flick Overall Tomb Raider is a good film with a few flaws but its still a fun time at the movies
