I liked Alicia Vikander a lot and I liked individual parts of the movie but all of the parts together felt like they didnt exactly go together so well Most of the film seemed like it was trying to be a fun action adventure but then theres a handful of scenes that feel way too darkbrutaldramatic compared to the rest of the film
