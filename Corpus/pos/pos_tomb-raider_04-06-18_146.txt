Im sorry but Im not feeling very inspired to write a good review right now but this was an average action movie  nothing was unexpected for me Of course Alicia Vikander is really amazing and she did a pretty good job at interpretating this iconic charming and quite sarcastic character I have watched this film with my friends and there were some serious scenes during which we could not help but laugh Perhaps thats why Im giving this a pretty high rating
