Overpaid to see this in 3D for the record since I need to get those Regal Points Anyway this was OK Its kind of generic as an action film but there is enough action present to keep fans satisfied And this was second Walton Goggins sighting this year although he doesnt play a deformed man in this It just sucks to see him playing a baddie I have to give this film credit for having a pretty fun cast though
