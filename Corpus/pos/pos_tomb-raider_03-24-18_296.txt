I wish there was more tomb raiding but overall a fun action adventure flick Vikander is great as Lara Goggins is a little toned down but always fun to watch They did a lot of good things with this where they had opportunity to royaly blow it Maybe dipped into the Last Crusade well one time too many Otherwise fun
