So I watched the new Tomb Raider today in Imax its a video game movie and since Assasins Creed I always lower my expectations for this kind of movies and I think that is the way to go in this This movie is fast does action in a way I didnt see in a long time and it has amazing actors not all of them do amazing acting in this movie but still we need to put in perspective Go
