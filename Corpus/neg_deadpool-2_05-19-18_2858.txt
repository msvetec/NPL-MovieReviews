This film wasnt as fun as the first one It took a while to find its footing and relied too much on meta and were making a movie jokes The CGI seemed off and that affected the action Josh Brolin was good and Zazie Beetz is a star in the making More Peter would have been nice too All in all I did laugh and have a good time but Deadpool 2 just didnt give maximum effort
