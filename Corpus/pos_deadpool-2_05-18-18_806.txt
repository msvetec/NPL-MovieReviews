The greatest achievement of the Deadpool series so far is the complete embrace of anti commercial that is the character and the willingness to let Ryan Reynolds break the fourth wall and have fun  Deadpool is back with a lot more mayhem injokes and marvel characters and often times doing it better justice this time around For instance Collusus is improved and a surprise villian makes a way better appearance than lets say some terrible x men flick  Lets really really hope instead of Deadpool three they give us a Deadpool wolverine crossover
