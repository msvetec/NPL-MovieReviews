What a strange fucking movie On the one hand Im a little dissapointed the first act is a bit boring as a whole it felt rythmless and clunky and I hate that Rob Delaney and Terry Crews are basically not in the movie but on the other I had a great time watching it The action is phenomenal Domino is fucking awesome so is fireboy Josh Brolin is perfect and above all I laughed my fucking ass off The first 15 min is the strangest tonal tight rope walk Ive ever seen That fucking end credits scene though
