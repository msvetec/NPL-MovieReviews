I thought the first Deadpool movie was nice but didnt quite connect the humor action characters and story quite right Deadpool 2 lands it The story is nice its the Looper story of someone coming from the future to kill a kid to save their family and realizing that they need to avoid the traumatic event that turned that kid to kill in the future in the first place This movie kills it with the cast Josh Brolin is more
