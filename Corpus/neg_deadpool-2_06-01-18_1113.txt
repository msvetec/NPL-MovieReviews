I honestly find it hard to hate a movie with so many great filthy deaths that takes the ironic aspect not as an excuse but as its own world of absurd possibilities Too bad that again this isnt in the hands of someone delighted enough with its violent fantasies to actually make some point out of it I never though I could write this one day but by now I would certainly watch a Deadpool movie directed by David Ayer
