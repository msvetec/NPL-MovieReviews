It was okay Things I liked almost all of the action scenes the New Zealand kid Domino Cable most of the edgy humor the entire babylegs scene Things I didnt like the entire beginning TJ Miller the death scene most of the meta humor There just were a lot of scenes of people talking with mediocre jokes And the beginning was rough Also it might just be me but they way Deadpool uses film terms to be meta isnt inherently funny to me
