This movie felt like an absolute bum rushed mesh of shit The CGI was suprisingly bad the story had no impact or thought and just about everything else was either shit or mediocre at best The jokes were the only semidecent parts of the film and to be honest a lot of them fell flat or became hard to watchÂ
