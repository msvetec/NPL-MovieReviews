Deadpool 2  Ive literally overheard my son sleep talking incoherently about nightmares involving fish that have made more sense than this fking mindless drivel Devoid of plot pacing structure narrative or emotion A testament in how not to make a film despite having all the ingredients there If Ryan hadnt have shelled out nearly 30 on tickets to see this a film he had no desire to see I would have walked out Simply boring and awful
