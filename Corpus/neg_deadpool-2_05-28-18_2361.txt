I wanted more of the comedy that made Deadpool such an entertaining film and less of the action which kinda made this feel a bit generic Plus the I want Deadpool to make me laugh not to open his heart to me Its not often I say stuff like that however theres a time and a place and DP2 seems to have lost a little of that magic
