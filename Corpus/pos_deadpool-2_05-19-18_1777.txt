Conceptually I dont like Deadpool I never really haveI find him annoying the humor to be void of cleverness and horribly juvenile and the schtick to be tired after 15 minutes Deadpool 2016 was well a Deadpool movie that I didnt really like but it got by being a thoroughly unremarkable superhero origin story with a justcharmingenough leading man and being justwellmadeenough to be a competent forgettable little movie whose absurd popularity only made its flaws more apparent to me
