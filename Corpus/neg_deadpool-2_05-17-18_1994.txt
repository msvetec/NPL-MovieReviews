Deadpool gets another goround in a sequel that doubles down on the excruciating look what I dare to poke fun at jokes The issue is that these quick quips and popculture laden injokes dont work but seem a desperate attempt of screenwriters to stay remotely relevant in a popculture lanscape dictated by spandex and superheroteamup The jokes are crass and bland layered upon a waferthin story in disparate manner I did chuckle a couple of times but more often than not I rolled my eyes at the way how the filmmakers are taking the wellworn If it aint brokeadage to exhausting heights
