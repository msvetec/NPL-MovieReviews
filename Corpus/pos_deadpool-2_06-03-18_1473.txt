Its weird I shouldve hated the first film  something about the smartass metacommentary and gleeful teeheehee look it how casually we chop off limbs in this and look it how Rrated we can make this and rub it in the squares faces I guess But I was surprisingly won over Same goes for the sequel only I liked this one even more
