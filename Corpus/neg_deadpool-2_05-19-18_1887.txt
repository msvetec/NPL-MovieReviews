well this film definitely had more substance than its predecessor feeling slightly more like a fully developed narrative than the barebones origin story there were a few pretty shots here and there but overall there wasnt really much to it I wanted more Morena Baccarin in this one but I got even LESS than the first one Zazie Beetz asÂ Domino was just fantastic to watch but Josh Brolin as Cable once again was the highlight for me I dig his Final Fantasy  cyborg time traveler aesthetic
