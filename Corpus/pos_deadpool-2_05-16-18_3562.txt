I think I like it just about as much as the first one maybe even more on a rewatch There are quite a few unexpected surprises that happen in the film which was nice to see from a Marvel movie I didnt find the humour that funny but there were definitely some scenes where I was laughing my ass off shout out to the mid credit scene
