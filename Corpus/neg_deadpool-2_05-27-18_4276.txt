This could have should have been a 15hour film The children give people a second chance to be better theme soured things a little for me They did Vanessa so dirty There were more references to the MCU in this than the entirety of the Netflix series lineup Oh look its another female Asian character with funkycoloured hair Not reading up on this or watching any of the promotional materials beforehand made the cameos and jokes enjoyable Zazie Beetz was the films breakout star and bright spot The opening credits were great too
