i mean whatever it was serviceable passable meh i laughed a few times  very hard not to with a movie this loud and energetic lets be real  and zazie beetz is awesome but god this formula has gotten so stale so quickly and doesnt come off half as inspired as it did in the first film which the more i think about it wasnt that unique or groundbreaking either
