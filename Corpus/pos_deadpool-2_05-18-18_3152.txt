Loved this film and will be watching it again The tone and jokes just work all the way around for me Wades and Vanessa grounds the comedy and story to where the comedy never goes off track Im not sure I buy into the overall story as much as I did the first film but it is still and great followup The beginning and end credits alone are worth the price of admission with a great middle sandwiched between or a chimichanga
