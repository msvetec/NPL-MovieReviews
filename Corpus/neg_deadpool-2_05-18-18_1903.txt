Weirdly low energy and way too plot heavy I DOO NOOT CAARE about Sladeer Wade Wilson and trying to get us invested in his emotional journey is pointless and boring Some okay jokes here and there but it only really comes alive during the parachute sequence Zazie Beetz is pretty good Josh Brolin is catatonic Ricky Baker is underutilized
