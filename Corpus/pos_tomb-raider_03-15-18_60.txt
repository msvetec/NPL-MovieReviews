Well it wasnt bad in fact Tomb Raider turned out to be a very fun and decent action movie At first I thought that Alicia Vikander is a total miscast not because of her complexion but she looks to innocent if you compare her to Angelina Jolies Lara but I admit I was mistaken The story is basically a plot of 2013s reboot of Tomb Raider where Lara is unexperienced and just learning shooting killing and so on and so
