Lotsa laughs lotsa action lotsa feels Ryan Reynolds is once again absolutely perfect as Deadpool Josh Brolin was damn good as Cable and Zazie Beetz was great as Domino plus some fun cameos rounded out the cast Colossus my fav XMen looked less bulky than he did in the first movie but something still seemed off to me maybe my expectations aste just too high The action scenes were awesome which is to be expected from the codirector of John Wick and the director of Atomic Blonde So very fun at the cinema
