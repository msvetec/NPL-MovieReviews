This was fun People say Superhero fatigue is a myth but its real for me At least with the Deadpool movies theres the irreverent meta 4th wallbreaking shtick Give me this over the fauxgravitas of Avengers any day More of the same from the first movie possibly funnier but not very rewatchable I think Dopinder is my favourite Would be nice for Morena Baccarin to have a more developed role than Hot Girlfriend These films are the only time I can tolerate Ryan Reynolds
