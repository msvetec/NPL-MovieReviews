Deadpool 2 is funny at times but its in spite of Deadpool and not because of him Basically the only thing he does is shout references at people which isnt particularly funny at all The supporting cast is the one who draws the most laughs Domino for example or the majority of the Xforce team he gathers up When the comedy gets physical its at its best when they actually work with him being immortal and surviving impossible situations
