Dell pool made by dell computer systems best part of the movie is when detective baby legs lets his Jawn dangle I enjoyed although every joke the kid says was literally ripped straight out of hunt for the wilderpeople like almost word for word So that movie is better than this movie but Ryan Reynolds constant marvel and dc jokes were pretty good Also it is an unwritten rule that at every deadpool movie someone sits behind you and repeats every punch line to every joke out loud and laughs louder than everyone else and claps to himself
