Deadpool 2 overcomes its predecessors shortcomings by intelligently avoiding the tired overblown climax hampering the comic book genre and swapping it with a smaller more focused finale The narrative is kept at appropriately lower stakes while still being capable of delivering tension and Zazie Beetzs Domino and Josh Brolins Cable are excellent additions to the cast Its also gutbustingly hilarious thanks to Reese Wernick and Reynolds screenplay taking even more shots at the XMen franchise as well as more common film tropes
