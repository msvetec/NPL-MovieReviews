Fans of the first movie will not be disappointed with the follow up  The sequel is highly enjoyable and loses none of its over the top violence and vulgarity that made the original so endearing  So many cleverly inserted funny lines and Easter eggs aplenty that will require more than one viewing to catch them all  Josh Brolin as Cable is pretty fantastic  With all of the hilarious moments and breaking of the fourth wall its impossible not to enjoy this  My only complaint is not enough Morena Baccarin  Great fun
