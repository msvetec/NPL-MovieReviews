This movie has its funny parts but ultimately it feels a little stale It just doesnt seem to have the same level of passion behind it as the first film  I cant imagine another Deadpool solo movie after this one  I feel that the pivot to the next film being an XForce movie is a smart choice Hes really just a one trick pony Not that thats a bad thing  I do feel that the Deadpool movies are the closest
