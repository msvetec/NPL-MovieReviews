The perfect companion to its predecessor this movie is neither better nor worse than the first Deadpool Just as funny and reckless Deadpool 2 improves on the original with its story cast and characters but also doesnt feel as fresh or as daring I absolutely loved the airdrop scene and the subsequent car chase I thought the additions of Cable and Domino were awesome and I would love to see more of them in the future
