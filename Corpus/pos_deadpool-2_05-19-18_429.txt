Absolutely fantastic Reynolds truly has found his role of a lifetime He nails the titular character again His comedic timing is excellent but he also shows off an emotional side again that was only touched upon in the original Josh Brolin adds another great villain to his resume Along with the rest of the supporting cast they more than ably assist to create a movie equal if not better than the original Love all the Superhero Universe references especially the constant Wolverine mentions Definitely recommend
