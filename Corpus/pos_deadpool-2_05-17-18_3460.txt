Deadpool 2 is all the bad things most sequels are bigger more explosions and louder Luckily its also the funniest movie of the year Ryan Reynolds returns as the merc with a mouth and hes even more irreverent this time Taking shots at the DCEU MCU and thank God Frozen among many others The opening credit sequence and the credit stingers really pop The rest is hit and miss but when it hits well I laughed harder than I have
