Deadpool 2 is what a great sequel should be it delivers more and better off of what the original film built so well Its a constant riot full of great action gags smart meta humor  well balanced between well known and more obscure references to movies high five for a Say Anything reference and superhero material mainly DCMarvelComics my audience missed about 14 of the references in total The selfreferences to the films own structure are sharp and smarter
