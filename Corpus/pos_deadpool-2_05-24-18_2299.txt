Im not sure whats wrong with me but typically when I watch a comedy film I come out upset because most the jokes just fly over my head But damn watching this movie was like getting combo punched in the gut by Mike Tyson except instead of punches theyre all punchlines and instead of painful grunts theyre joyful laughter
