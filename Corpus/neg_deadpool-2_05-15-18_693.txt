Deadpool 2 is the personification of more is less filmmaking It casts its net bigger but reaps fewer rewards by comparison Its still sporadically amusing and entertaining when its not repeating jokes or trying so hard to shock or manipulate the audience and Reynolds lead is as dedicated as ever but it feels like it runs out of gas before the credits start rolling
