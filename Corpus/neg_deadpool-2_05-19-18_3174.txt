Jokes are very hit or miss and the meta humor gets stale after let me think the first joke Plot makes absolutely zero sense and the character motivations probably make negative sense Action scenes were ok and you can definitely tell that David Leitch was inspired by his friend Zack Snyder but the visual effects department shouldve been chastised by Deadpool in one of his meta jokes Ie the VFX are absolutely awful not Justice League bad though
