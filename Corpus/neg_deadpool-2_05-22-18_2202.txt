A messy and Ryan Reynolds BJ giving film Attempted to reach higher than the original movies charm and originality but fell short because of over done jokes a weak plot that had to kill Vanessa in order to establish a stupid emotional motivation for Deadpool More than a few of the jokes were funny and Domino was a fresh addition to the cast of characters which keeps me rating it any lower than 2 StarsÂ
