I used to be a big fan of Deadpools breaking the fourth wall jokes but having flawed screenwriting and some unsuccessful moments of the film to use as a joke is irritating and unacceptable I hardly cracked a smile as some jokes really didnt do justice for me I dont know if it was because of how late the screening was and how tired I was but nevertheless I never really enjoyed this the first or second viewing I did
