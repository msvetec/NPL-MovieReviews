The rare comic book sequel thats better then the original Not only did I love every new character in Deadpool 2 except for Fire Fist but i laughed out loud at almost every joke I also thought the action set pieces were bigger and visually more interesting which was my biggest complaint about the first film Overall I thought it was a ActionComedie that excelled at both Yes it has some plot holes and the visual FX arent the greatest
