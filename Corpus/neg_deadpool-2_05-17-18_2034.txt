There are some great one liners that thankfully arent all in the trailers Some nice twists and another awesome soundtrack Deadpool fans will love it but imo not as good as first are they ever It is overly graphic which makes me question the 15 rating Good romp and will stay with the franchise and see where it goes The credits snapshots are probably the best thing
