its a regular thing to bring time travel into a sequel to oil the wheels of a difficult plot and allow both the sad death of a lead character and their resurrection DPII plays homage to terminator and plants tongue firmly in cheek for the inception like movie references Not a ttmovie but with enough tt plot to be worthy of inclusion This is a great film but not a great tt film
