Yeah I liked this a bit less on a rewatch There are so many good components  especially with the addition of interesting new characters like Cable Domino and Russell  Â but the plot is overstuffed and convoluted and attempts to juggle far too many storylines in my opinion It tries to channel the smallscale charm of the first film alongside the greater ambitions of a larger cinematic universe in preparation for XForce and comes up short on both fronts
