This movie has a surprising amount of heart and might have been even more affecting if it hadnt tried to undercut its sincerity constantly also a reference is not the same as a joke and I would have like the reference to actual joke reference to be a little more even The best part may have been all the supporting performances  Josh Brolin Zazie Beetz but a special shout out to Julian Dennison for making me care about him and The Hunt for the Wilderpeople
