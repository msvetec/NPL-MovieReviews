The problem I have with this film is that the story is totally unimportant and therefore even though I was entertained I was never interested in absolutely anything that was happening on the screen Deadpool 2 is a mixture of black humour metareferences and violence that in my opinion do not work quite well and even reaches the point where it almost gets out of control in its attempt to be provocative and irreverent Ryan Reynolds charisma keeps together a film that seems more like a set of gags that take advantage of the formula that worked in the first installment but feels slightly oversaturated
