Deadpool is so much fun because hes simultaneously a parody of superheroes and a better one These movies know when and how to poke fun and when and how to have a heart I will say that I thought this one had a few too many meta jokes that will become irrelevant the second the movie leaves theaters obviously everyone who goes into this is signing on for that but there were a LOT but it did make me laugh out loud the entire time so _ãƒ„_
