I have no doubts when I say that Deadpool 2 is the funniest superhero movie ever made It takes a lot to make me laugh in a movie but Deadpool 2 is flat out hilarious Of course not all jokes worked but most of them worked really well From the opening scene to the midcredits scene it works very well David Leitch one of the directors of John Wick makes this movie more than another Deadpool movie This elevates itself
