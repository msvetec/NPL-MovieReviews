Arguably funnier than the first but there were a few too many fourth wall breaks for my liking The plot also didnt really exist till the third act but I did enjoy a lot of the mishaps that came before it Domino is also the coolest character in the x men franchise like god damn every scene with her in was gold Still this was a hell of a lot of fun hit a lot more serious notes than the first though which was pretty cool Would recommend for any fans of the first film
