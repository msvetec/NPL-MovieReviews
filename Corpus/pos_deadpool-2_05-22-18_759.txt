It shakes the weird feeling the first deadpool movie gave me and grows to something bigger I only now feel like this is the deadpool that we waited so long for Deadpool 1 was good but was less than what i wanted and expected Deadpool 2 made me glad this character was finally put to film But I would like to see more extravagant plots like the comics but with similar heart as this movie Im glad deadpool and his world are becoming bigger
