While I dont need a Deadpool every year I love it when they come around I enjoy the frequent semi serious Marvel outings and to some extent DCs gloomy theatrics but Deadpool hits me on a completely different level and I appreciate it for that DP2 is like a MAD magazine movie parody come to life and a breath of fresh air to me And while it most certainly wont hold up well on repeat viewings I had a fucking blast watching this
