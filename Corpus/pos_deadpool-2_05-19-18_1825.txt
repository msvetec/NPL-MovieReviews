My new favourite film of the year I would honestly pay the money to go see it again The action was great the comedy was funny and for what it was meant to be it succeeded Josh Brolin was a fantastic choice as Cable He couldnt have done it any better The jokes made me laugh and I loved the end credits scenes Love this film
