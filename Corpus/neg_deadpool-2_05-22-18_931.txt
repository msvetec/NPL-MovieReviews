As I had imagined there was no way this could live up to the original film in that it wouldnt be able to surprise us with its irreverent humor this time around There were actually a few boring scenes the Icebox sequence and the final orphanage battle that felt as if they could have been lifted from a canonical Marvel film The best thing about this film was the Bondcreditsequence parody
