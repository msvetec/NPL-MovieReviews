Has almost exactly the same strengths and weaknesses as the first film which is honestly a little frustrating And the action sequences are actually a bit incoherent at times But Josh Brolins Cable is a superb addition and has excellent chemistry with Reynolds and the film is overall a good time But its not as funny as it thinks it is and not as clever as it should be And its not gay enough dammit
