I went into this knowing it would be good But I didnt think it wouldve been THIS good The humor in Deadpool 2 was absolutely hilarious In my opinion Id say its funnier than the first LOADS of a great variety of film references which is always great The action scenes were also very greatgory Along with great action scenes came great visuals Josh Brolin was absolutely great too They couldnt have done Cable any better Whatever you do you
