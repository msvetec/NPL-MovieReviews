Flawed and I wouldnt call it overstuffed so much as fast paced and laserfocused on Deadpool instead of ever truly branching out what Im saying is this is not Deadpool AND Cable Deadpool 2 is a marked improvement over Leitchs previous film Atomic Blonde and in my opinion bests even the original Deadpool Ajax was as forgettable as he was wasted
