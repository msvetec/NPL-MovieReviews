Deadpool 2 is a gloriously over the top and fun action comedy and a major improvement upon the first The majority of the comedy in this film lands which is rare among comedy sequels nowadays although there were a few misses mainly with TJ Millers character Josh Brolin is excellent as Cable but I wish he got more screentime The real breakout character to me is Zazie Beets Domino I really hope we get more of her in the future
