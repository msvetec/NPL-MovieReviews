Just not for me Excels at evolving and tightening the unique blend of crass and meta humor of the first film a clear indicator that its creators know what they have in this franchise Theres some good jokes here and there the movie is wellcasted as well I just dont care for what Deadpool 2 brings to the table I like a degree of sincerity in my superhero movies not the complete irreverence this brings to the genre I appreciate
