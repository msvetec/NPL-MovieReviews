25  5  Lightning never strikes twice And also we can see the influence of Disney over this film If the first was a nice surprise full of memorable moments and genuinely funny the sequel is just a pasteurised emulation which will allow you to giggle a few times during the nearly 2 hours It is a bit too long the end is corny the jokes arent fresh and overall it is the usual Disney shit To not be a complete disaster at least there a few good moments a few nice references and the extra scenes are actually funny
