I loved the first Deadpool so I had very high expectations for this one I was a little disappointed I still enjoyed this movie a lot but I didnt love it like I thought I would Maybe it is because the first one was so fresh and different and simple and the sequel is more of the same just more complicated It could also be the promotion cycle just overloading on jokes and taking a little bit of the wind
