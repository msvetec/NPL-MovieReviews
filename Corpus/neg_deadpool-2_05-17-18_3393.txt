The first 3035 minutes are emotional and funny and it works After that there are laughs solid action but a lot of down time More than I thought Unlike the first one there were plenty of jokes that didnt work There were more that did than didnt but sometimes Deadpool can talk too much for his own good Some characters felt absolutely useless in the end and a good chunk of the movie was flat Also the kid was pretty lame Some ass kicking and funny moment were there but less often than the first Good time but could and should have been better
