Comedy masterpieces like The Naked Gun and Airplane were so great because they never let up on the jokes never even tried to take themselves seriously This insistence that modern Hollywood has with emotionally grounding even their most stupid comedies annoys me to no end No one would bat an eye if all the girlfriend scenes and family business was wiped out of Deadpool 2 entirely and the movie just allowed itself a lot more room for laughs Were coming for the jokes make a comedy not an unironic superhero movie that just happens to have funny parts
