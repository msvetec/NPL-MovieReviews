A cursing violent 4th wall breaking meta antihero does appear easy to pull of but just as well as the first Deadpool was it could easily not work it can run to the ground get old and unlikable and uninteresting but Deadpool 2 pulls of not really doing anything different in fact doubling down with so much more insanity and somehow im not complaining about it I guess what works in this sequel is Wade Wilson i actually really enjoy
