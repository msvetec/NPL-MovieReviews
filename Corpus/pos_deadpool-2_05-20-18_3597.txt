Deadpool 2 elicited some of the heartiest laughs Ive uttered in awhile The kind of laughter where I felt compelled to annoyingly nudge my date to make sure she understood how funny I thought it was And I learned something too A new phrase Shirt cocking So thats something I really liked the first Deadpool but found its detours into darker corners kind of off putting Nothing majorly upsetting it just felt like the movie was fighting its own best
