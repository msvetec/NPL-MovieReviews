The first movie was funnier and fresher but this one was still a lot of fun I enjoyed the thrust of it and if a lot of the jokes dont play so well and the I cant believe they killed her Joke in the credits takes on an unpleasant double meaning in light of a stuntwomans death it still moves fast picking up a lot of momentum as it goes Dont miss the midcredits scenes which leave the film on a brighter note than the actual ending which doesnt mitigate the downer elements of the movie all too much
