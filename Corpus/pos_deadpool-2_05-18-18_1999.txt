Way funnier gorier and more self aware than the first Deadpool The first Deadpool had lots of laughs and I enjoyed every minute of it but this one had some of the most laugh out loud moments Ive ever had in a theater and some action sequences that were awesome and brutal This movie also manages to take it up a whole other level at making fun of other franchises and pieces of pop culture and does it without a single worry in the world This movie is a hell of a time at the movies and it will make you absolutely cry of laughter
