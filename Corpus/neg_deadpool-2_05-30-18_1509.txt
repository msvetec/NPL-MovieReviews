I never like to admit that a certain mouse I know is right but this movie wasnt too great The acting was awful from Julian Dennison and I legitimately wanted his character to die the entire time Cable was great and I really enjoyed his character but once again the time travel aspect had an insane amount of holes in it There were some massively cheap looking CGI affects and many of the jokes fell flat Ill always watch the next Deadpool movie but this was honestly disappointing
