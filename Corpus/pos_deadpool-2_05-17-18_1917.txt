In some ways its even better than the first one I quite liked the addition of Cable and Domino to the main cast The way the movie dealt with XForce was absolutely brilliant in my opinion and no doubt meant to lampoon Suicide Squad I do think the movie gets a bit too meta at times especially the thats just lazy writing line Overall though I did enjoy most of the superhero references especially the ones that outright shat on
