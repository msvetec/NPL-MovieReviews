Most reviews for David Leitchs sequel to Tim Millers 2016 film Deadpool begin with its not as good as the first one Well in trying to be original Ill go with its nowhere near as good as the first one I didnt care for the main protagonist Firefist thought the story was lightweight despite the scenestealing turn from Josh Brolins Cable and missed Morena Baccarins Vanessa more than Wade Wilson did The addition of Juggernaut and especially Domino were highlights
