This film is so damn good The comedy is spot on with what Deadpool would say and do It totally improves on the first in the sense that the previous was bogged down in exposition This was just pure fun Deadpool action It is also a refreshing change from ultra serious movies if the same genre 100 recommended Go see it but maybe leave the kids at home
