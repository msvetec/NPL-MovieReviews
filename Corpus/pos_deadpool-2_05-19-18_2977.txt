My god was this sensational I was a bit hesitant to really give this one a score cause I couldnt really decide what I thought about this But I can now say that this is better than the first film in my opinion I know that the tone adjusts a lot but it mostly works I say mostly cause there are a few moments serious moments that feel weird with the jokes in them But most of them work
