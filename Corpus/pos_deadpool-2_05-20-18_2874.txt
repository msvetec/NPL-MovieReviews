Deadpool is back and as same as ever The fourth wall comedy wears thin The film tries to combine emotional moments with absurd ones and it doesnt excel at it The action is highly stylized and very well directed The kills are exceptional The film suffers at the hands of its odd structure and pacing The first act is muddled with its contrived romance The third act is stymied by a poorly executed elongated scene that wears out its welcome
