I feel like the first movie was an action film with comedy in it whereas this one is a comedy with action happening every so often Characters are introduced and dispatched with wild abandon Hello Shatterstar and Black Tom Bye Shatterstar and Black Tom The jokes and characters have a 50 hit rate did anyone really care whether the chubby kid became evil or not Plus why does every superhero film have to kill the love interest at some point
