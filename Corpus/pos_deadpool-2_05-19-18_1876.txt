Much much bigger funnier more emotional and BETTER than the first The story and characters have a newfound maturity that was nowhere to be seen in the first installment Personally I think that this is because of the introduction of Brolins Cable a villain with a very sympathetic edge Throw in some cameos hit and miss jokes and a lot of blood and youve got a mindnumbing film that meets the mark
