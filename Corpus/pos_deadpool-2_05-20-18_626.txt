The selfreferencing and camerawinking are a little less charming this time around and without the existential dread of the first installment Wade Wilsons quippynes is a little less interesting a fact the screenwriters tried to address with more meta commentary about his annoyingnes but theres still a lot to like It works as a comedy Cables cool And XForce  everything about XForce The selfconscious thing will get old but its also part of the BList charm of this character in this sort of side section of the Marvel universe And Ryan Reynolds is perfect in it
