I think the most surprising thing about Deadpool 2 is that its not joke after joke after joke which was one of the unfortunate issues I had with its predecessor it balances comedy decently around all of the storytelling working along side eachother to reach the goal of competency rather than clashing with one another It also has jokes that dont just pander to what everyone knows there are many obscure and fun references to a vast variety of things
