I was a fan of the first one and was looking forward to this one for a long time but I was always waiting with trepidation Could this sequel live up to the first one since it would lose one of the things that made the first one so appealing which was its fresh and Rrated take on superheroes Would it be a rehash of the same type of jokes and action scenes and would it suffer as many comedies
