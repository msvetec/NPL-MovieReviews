While I liked the first Deadpool film quite a bit I found that I didnt love it as much as I originally did when I revisited it a few days ago Deadpool 2 on the other hand took me by surprise Id seen some awful reviews so went in not expecting much but apart from some pacing issues I absolutely loved everything about it Yes its similar to the first film but everything was so much better The humour action
