Deadpool 2 suffers slightly from Sequelitis but by no means is this a bad film Trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice was always going to be a tough ask but I think they did a good enough job to warrant some praise High Points The James Bondesque title sequence Anything with the XForce arguably one of the greatest post credit scenes of alltime and of course Ryan Reynolds Low Points Big CGI Fights and TJ Miller Definitely worth the watch if you ask me
