I think the running verdict here is that all thats offered here is more of the same Its true in the sense that Deadpool Reynolds and co all reenter the big screen with the same coy swagger and confidence that fuelled the first film only this time driven by popular consensus and oodles more cash Allowing the bar to be raised closer to the roof but still feeling short of becoming true idiosyncratic potential
