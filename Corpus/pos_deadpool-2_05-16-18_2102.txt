Deadpool 2 is better than the original but fails to establish the same quality of humour The jokes range from hilarious to cringeworthy and many are recycled from the original with varying levels of success The action is excellent and its nice to see a wider range that of characters in action through the XForce though the cgi is a bit wonky Overall I think this a more compelling watch over the original despite its short comingsÂ
