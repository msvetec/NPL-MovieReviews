Its perfect for what it wants to be And whats it wants to be is a violent hysterical well structured memorable film It doesnt have to prove that Rrated superhero movies work so its more free to be comfortable as its own entity the violence has been kicked up to a glorious level almost never seen in widely distributed films today and the jokes are wonderful Oh and the end credit sequence is worth buying a ticket for both movies Id pay for a Bluray of just the end credit scene
