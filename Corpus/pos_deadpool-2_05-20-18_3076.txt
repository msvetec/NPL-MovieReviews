Didnt enjoy it as much as the first but maybe its because the novelty is wearing off Its the supporting cast that kills it this time especially Zazie Beets and Josh Brolin Kudos for the awesome ways they showed Dominos powers at work btw She was always one of my favorite Xers but her power has always been one of the hardest to justify
