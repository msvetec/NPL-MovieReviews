If you loved the first film youll love this one Its still more of the same narratively speaking but its still fun which is how it thrives for millions It is no way remarkable or groundbreaking but youre guaranteed a fun time if you know how to just lay back and have fun I think this was better than the first film which clearly showed weakness in its budget constraints and the story was pretty bare bones This time around its simmering with a lot more energy Josh Brolin owns the role of Cable and Reynolds is great as usual
