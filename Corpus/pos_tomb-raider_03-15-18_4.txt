i guess this is an iteration of tomb raider that takes itself more seriously  but in a way it also doesnt and thats what i kinda love about it there are cheesy oneliners lara kicks a guy in the balls theres a nick frost cameo for gods sake because of that it reminded me of the silly adventure movies i adored as a kid like the mummy and national treasure its nice that little girls have another action hero to look up to
