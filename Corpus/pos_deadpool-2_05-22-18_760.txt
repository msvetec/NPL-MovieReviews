I like the first Deadpool film but I do think its aged poorly and is overall just average despite all the subversive gimmickry This though I thought was much better Its not hilarious and a lot of the jokes are a bit lazy theres a lot of superhero namedropping but theres undeniably a bit more substance this time round The plot is less by the numbers the drama lands with more weight and we just generally get a better look
