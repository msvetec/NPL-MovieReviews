honestly wasnt interested at all in the first act of the film jokes missed left and right and the style felt way too familiar and overdone after the fucking hilarious skydiving scene the film pretty much gets better from there in fact i dont think i remember a time i laughed this hard in the theaters with that being said its a shame that this film relies so much on clever commentary that it makes the genuine moments far less tragic than they really are but dp 2  dp 1
