This film is more like trying to pat itself on the back for the achievements of doing things that more highly acclaimed films have done Not that its a horrible thing to do But really Breaking the forth way with a terrible payoff and no rhythm whatsoever Unsurprisingly the ending was a major disappointment it didnt make sense and it went on for a bit too long To no avail timetravelling doesnt seem fit with the narrative and the whole voiceover thing is getting old One thing they got consistent though is shoving down the audiences throats with eyerolling pop culture quips
