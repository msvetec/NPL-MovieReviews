A ton of jokes and references I cant even remember them all The movie was funny and very entertaining However not better than the first one in my opinion Deadpool 2 fell into the trap of trying to do too much just because it is a sequel Some jokes felt repetitive Some characters only had a line or two before disappearing Cable was fcking great Definitely a good year for Josh Brolin with Marvel Same with Ryan he proves again
