Time will tell on this one but this might actually be superior to the first Once again the story keeps a relatively narrow focus for a superhero movie but it also manages to expand its world to fullon comic book insanity It also does a better job than most XMen movies at using mutants as analogs for oppressed people without beating us over the head with the same old story and message And naturally its facehurtingly hilarious with some amazing action sequences one of which is staged to Dolly Partons 9 to 5
