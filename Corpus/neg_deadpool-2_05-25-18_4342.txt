Spretty good I didnt like it as much as Deadpool though I felt a bit too big like parts of it had become the things the first one mocked Oh time for a big CGI fight And then theres a CGI fight Its funnier when he forgets his guns and has a small tightly cut action scene and less fun when he points out how big and Hollywood something is then indulges in it
