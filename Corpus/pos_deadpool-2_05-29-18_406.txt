I absolutely hated the first movie I hated its smug sense of CinemaSinsderived cleverness about itself I hated how it went out of its way to make many patronizing gestures towards political correctness just so it could justify a thoroughly straight white mans fantasy of violence and empowerment I hated how it patronized its own genre without offering any new ideas or directions of its own and I hated listening to Ryan Reynolds voice for almost two hours
