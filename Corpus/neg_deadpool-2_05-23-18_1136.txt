A steaming pile of shit Ill admit I laughed a few times but wow is this film soulless From its opening scene it gives the viewer little reason to care Life is pointless death is expected Its dialogue is not intellectual as many have claimed it to be Its a lazy attempt to throw crap at the wall and see what sticks
