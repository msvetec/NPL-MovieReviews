This exceeds the original in every way Sure Deadpool loses a bit of camera time to the supporting characters but theyre all interesting so it balances well Josh Brolin is great as Cable same for Zazie Beetz as Domino I think this sequel takes alot of risks in developing Wade Wilsons character and I love how they stayed true to that storyline Also Spoiler the addition of Juggernaut gives a couple of incredible scenes and I hope they bring back that character despite where hes left
