I was a much bigger fan of the first Deadpool movie Idk this just felt like the same thing as the first one just glammed up if that makes sense You could tell it was a sequel of a movie that did really well It was seriously funny though of course Domino was the best character and I loved the way they filmed her ability And the XForce team LMAO overall it was pretty good I just wish it wouldve had some of the grit from the first one And I wish Vanessa didnt die 5mins in
