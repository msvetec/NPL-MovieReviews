I can see faults in this for sure but I really loved it was everything that I wantedexpected from the first film which I saw for the first time only 2 days before  It felt braver and more creative in a lot of ways Clearly a bigger budget and more freedom Not a load of laughoutloud funny moments a fair few jokes fall flat but entertaining the whole way through A likeable film that is top of a field it has basically created for itself
