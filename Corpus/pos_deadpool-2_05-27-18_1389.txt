I went in prepared to not like this movie as much as I liked the first one In spite of myself I actually walked out liking it BETTER than its predecessor The humor was sharp and selfdeprecating as I expected but it was funnier than I remember DP 1 being overall I question one of the major choices that is made early on but since it is so clearly foreshadowed like literally it was not a surprise Overall I had a great time which is really all I ask from my entertainment
