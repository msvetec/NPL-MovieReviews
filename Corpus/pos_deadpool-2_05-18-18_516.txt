A marked improvment on the first movie Deadpool 2 manages to layer its nonstop snark with some surprising emotional stakes The film smartly realizes it works best not having Deadpool shout into a void but pairing him with great foils The best are Julian Dennisons wild child at the emotional center of the film and Zazie Beetzs lackadaisical mercenary who nearly steals the movie Its a fun time one that goes down easy without taking itself too seriously
