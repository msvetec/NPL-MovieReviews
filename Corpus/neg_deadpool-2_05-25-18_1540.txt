Well its a slight improvement over the first Ill give it that There are some strong new cast additions particularly Josh Brolin having a banner year elevating superhero flicks and Zazie Beetz and some of the jokes are certainly enjoyable and inventive However I continue to be put off by how impressed with itself this franchise seems to be The incessant barrage of meta humour gets pretty grating after a while and I still cant decide if I find Reynolds entertainingly committed or smug and irritating To me the Deadpool style was done earlier and better in the first KickAss
