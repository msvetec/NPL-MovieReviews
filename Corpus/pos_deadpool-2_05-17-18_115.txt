If you liked the first then youll like the 2nd Perhaps the most entertaining and easily the funniest hero Deadpool on the big screen is simply irresistible Reynolds seems even more comfortable in the role this time around and owns every scene Most of the jokes land and Wilsons XForce are a nice addition although a debt is owed to a highly underrated scene in 2010s MacGruber Brolins Cable is my only concern here he doesnt live up to my expections But overall a solid entry and a must buy
