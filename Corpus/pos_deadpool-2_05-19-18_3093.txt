Hard to rate this movie Cool funny actionviolent amazing scenes love and friendship at one hand but at the same time easy sex jokes many references to the real world and about their movie writers I think was too much So there were moments that this movie arrived to the quality of the first one but right away drops to overdone giving us two or three scenes which that were too much
