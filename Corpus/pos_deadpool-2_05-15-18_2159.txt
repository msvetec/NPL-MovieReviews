I was going into this expecting something more of Kingsman 2 scenario  were the filmmakers might have bit of more than they could chew but after the credits had rolled they actually managed to surpass the original The biggest advantage this movie has over the first one is that it doesnt need to tell an origin story and it can get straight Deadpool even though the story this time is a rehash of T2 Judgment Day Although one thing that the first one did better was the soundtrack  Junkie XL was a better fit with his electric beats
