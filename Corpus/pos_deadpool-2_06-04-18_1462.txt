Characteristic raunchy and dry humour which makes Deadpool Deadpool and us coming back for a hilarious round two I love how the themes of family love and sacrifice are expounded upon in not an overly contrived manner which does justice to Deadpool and the supporting characters I have to say I think I enjoyed the first movie more but for a sequel this one definitely holds its own
